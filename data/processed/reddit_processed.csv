all,She erased us from her wedding. So I‚Äôm erasing her from mine.,"When my brother got married, his bride (now my sister-in-law) had very specific expectations. She wanted everyone in the family to wear their wedding colors, and we all did. People flew in from out of state. Everyone made an effort to make her feel celebrated.

The day before the wedding, she made some offhanded (but clearly pointed) remarks about how ‚Äúour side‚Äù of the family never takes anything seriously and she wasn‚Äôt expecting us to take this seriously either. The comments made their rounds, and feelings were hurt before the wedding even began. But we still showed up, looked great, and participated.

Fast forward to getting the wedding photos and video: not a single photo of our side of the family was posted. Not one. In the entire 3-minute highlight reel? No faces from our family, except a 3-second clip of my parents with the bride and groom. The rest of us? It‚Äôs like we never existed.

I texted her (cordially) and asked if she could send me the pictures with just our siblings, since none had been posted. She responded that we never took those pictures. That‚Äôs wild because I remember helping people adjust corsages for them. She doubled down on the gaslighting. I gave it six months and asked again‚Äîshe suddenly had no idea what I was talking about.

Fine.

Here‚Äôs where the petty revenge comes in.

I‚Äôm getting married in 8 days. I‚Äôve been engaged for 6 months and planning this moment since she tried to erase us. I hired a great photographer and videographer. What she doesn‚Äôt know is that the videographer has a secret mission: make it look like she‚Äôs getting all the attention. Track her. Hover near her like she‚Äôs the star of the show. She will feel so seen.

And then‚Ä¶ the final cut?

She won‚Äôt appear for even one second. Just like she made sure we didn‚Äôt.

I didn‚Äôt even invite her originally. Word must‚Äôve gotten out because she cornered me at a family dinner and said, ‚ÄúUnfortunately I have to work the day before and after your wedding, but I should still be able to make it.‚Äù I was so stunned I just said, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs fine. The Airbnb is booked whether you‚Äôre there or not.‚Äù So now she‚Äôs coming. Ugh.

To cope? I spelled her name wrong on the wedding invite on purpose. That was my first move. The video blackout will be my last.

Not asking for advice. Not asking if it‚Äôs ‚Äútoo mean.‚Äù It‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs exactly fair.

all,"UPDATE: AITAH for telling my MIL to stop calling herself ""Mom"" to my baby?","I just want to give you an update about by situation

Original Post

I was so happy when I gave birth to my daughter four months ago. Shes my first child and honestly it's been a rollercoaster ride for me. My husband has been great but the problem started with his mom. From day one my MIL has been very involved. She visited the hospital the day after I gave birth and was constantly hovering offering advice I didn‚Äôt ask for. I chalked it up to excitement. But then things started getting weird. She began referring to herself as Mommy when holding my daughter. At first I thought I misheard. But she kept doing it. When I gently corrected her she laughed it off like I was being silly. I told my husband it made me uncomfortable and he agreed it was odd but didn‚Äôt want to confront her because according to him ‚Äúthat‚Äôs just how she is.""

So I did. The next time she said it, I calmly said to her that, Please don‚Äôt call yourself Mom around my daughter. It‚Äôs confusing, and frankly, it‚Äôs not your role. She looked shocked then told me I was overreacting and that babies don‚Äôt understand titles at this age. I stood firm and said, Maybe not now, but she will soon. And I‚Äôm her mom. You‚Äôre her grandma. That should be a special title too. She got upset and left early. Later that day, I got a long text about how I embarrassed her, how she was just expressing lov and how I‚Äôm being territorial and insecure. Now some of my in-laws are saying I hurt her feelings and should apologize because it‚Äôs not like she‚Äôs trying to replace me. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm being insecure  I just want clear. My baby will only have one mom.

So‚Ä¶ AITAH for telling my MIL to stop calling herself ‚ÄúMom‚Äù to my baby?

  
Update:

Thanks to everyone who commented  reading your responses really helped me feel more grounded. I wanted to give an update because things definitely escalated, but in some unexpected ways. So, after the confrontation and her dramatic exit, my MIL went full hurt grandma mode. She told extended family I banned her from seeing the baby (which I didn‚Äôt and that I accused her of trying to kidnap her granddaughter (???). The group texts got wild. A few flying monkeys started chiming in about how I need help and how babies don‚Äôt care what you call yourself anyway. I didn‚Äôt respond to any of it. My husband finally stepped up and called her directly. He told her she needed to respect boundaries or there would be consequences. She cried (again), said she was just trying to love the baby the way she knew how and that I was turning him against her. She posted a photo of her holding our daughter on Facebook with the caption, Mommy‚Äôs girl. Publicly. Tagging family. That was my breaking point. I immediately texted her and said, Until you can respect the fact that I am her mother  not you  we are going to take a break from visits. My husband backed me up 100%. We‚Äôve since limited contact to just polite texts and occasional check-ins and no in-person visits for now. She hasn't apologized. So far, life has been a lot more peaceful. I‚Äôve gotten some icy texts from a couple family members, but more surprisingly a few others reached out privately to say they had similar issues with her and respected how I handled it.

all,TIFU by trying to flirt with a guy at the gym and ending up in a full-blown CPR situationüò≠,"So this happened yesterday and I‚Äôm still cringing so hard I might never step into that gym again.

I (22F) recently started going to this new gym, and there‚Äôs this insanely cute guy who works out around the same time as me. I‚Äôve been trying to find the courage to talk to him for a couple of weeks. Yesterday, I finally decided it was time.

I saw him doing deadlifts and I thought, ‚Äúokay, casual compliment, easy in.‚Äù So I walked by, smiled, and said, ‚ÄúYour lats are majestic.‚Äù Wtf? Majestic?? What was i thinking(???) üò≠üò≠üò≠
Idk why I said that. I meant to say ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre lifting a lot‚Äù or ‚ÄúNice form‚Äù or literally anything else.

He looked confused, said ‚Äúuh‚Ä¶ thanks?‚Äù and I panicked and decided to just walk away and die in the locker room.
While trying to speed-walk away in embarrassment, I tripped over a medicine ball someone left in the way, my face-planted into the floor, and I knocked the wind out of myself so hard I couldn‚Äôt breathe for like 20 seconds.
A trainer saw it happen, thought I was having a heart attack, and started actual CPR protocol before I could wheeze out ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine.‚Äù

That same cute guy helped hold my legs up while I got oxygen. Pretty sure I died inside.
Anyway, now I‚Äôm the ‚ÄúCPR girl‚Äù at the gym. And yes, I still plan to go back (I cannotüò≠).

popular,AITAH for refusing to chip in for a coworker's wedding gift after literally being uninvited?,"Alright AITAH ppl, imma need your hot takes on this office drama that's been driving me insane  
  
So I (27F) have been working at this marketing agency for about 2 years. My coworker Jess (31F) is getting married next month and initially invited our whole team (8 people) to her wedding. We're not like besties besties, but definitely friendly - lunch together sometimes, happy hours, the usual work friend stuff.  
  
Last week our office manager Sarah started collecting money for a group gift. She's asking for $200 each which would get us some fancy kitchen gadget from their registry. That's basically what I'd budget for someone I'm actually friends with, but whatever, I was planning to contribute.  
  
WELL. Yesterday I got the most awkward text from Jess saying they ""had to make some cuts to the guest list"" and unfortunately they couldn't accommodate me anymore. Something about venue capacity and family additions. But here's the kicker - I KNOW FOR A FACT that everyone else on our team is still invited!!! üôÉ  
  
This morning Sarah comes by my desk asking for my contribution to the gift fund. I politely told her that since I'm no longer invited, I'd rather get Jess a smaller gift on my own. Sarah looked shocked and said ""but it's a team gift"" and that not contributing the full amount would ""mess up the group harmony"" (like I give a single fuck)  
  
The icing on the cake? I know the wedding cut was because Jess invited her old coworker who just got a VP position at a major client. Suddenly there's ""no room"" for me, but I'm still expected to drop $200 on her registry?  
  
Can someone please tell me the truth if I'm the asshole for refusing to contribute the full amount to a wedding I'm not even attending?",11933.0,1532.0,2025-05-02 15:49:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1kd4bec/aitah_for_refusing_to_chip_in_for_a_coworkers/,aitah refuse chip coworker 's wed gift literally uninvited,15,92,6.133333333333334,0.0,0.0,alright aitah ppl imma need hot take office drama 's drive insane 27f work market agency 2 year coworker jess 31f get marry next month initially invite whole team 8 people wed 're not like besties besties definitely friendly lunch together sometimes happy hour usual work friend stuff last week office manager sarah start collect money group gift 's ask 200 would get u fancy kitchen gadget registry 's basically 'd budget someone 'm actually friend whatever plan contribute well yesterday get awkward text jess say make cut guest list unfortunately could n't accommodate anymore something venue capacity family addition 's kicker know fact everyone else team still invite morning sarah come desk ask contribution gift fund politely tell since 'm no longer invite 'd rather get jess smaller gift sarah look shock say 's team gift not contribute full amount would mess group harmony like give single fuck ice cake know wed cut jess invite old coworker get vp position major client suddenly 's no room 'm still expect drop 200 registry someone please tell truth 'm asshole refuse contribute full amount wed 'm not even attend,304,1747,5.746710526315789,-0.016749656593406596,0.4963827838827839,0.023981152459740175

The Airbnb is booked whether you‚Äôre there or not.‚Äù So now she‚Äôs coming. Ugh.

popular,Do men notice make up?,"When going out to dinner with my boyfriend I had curled my hair and done a full face of make up. When we got back, I told him I was going to wash my face so I could take off my make up and get comfortable. He looked me in my face and said, shocked, ""you're wearing make up???"" I'm not kidding, eyebrows done, eyeliner, blush, contour, lashes, the whole 9 yards.

So men, please tell me what is going on. Is he trying to be cute or did he seriously not notice

trendingreddits,How To Guide | The Smart Blogger‚Äôs Path to a Steady Online Income,"Blogging isn‚Äôt dead‚Äîit‚Äôs evolved. What once began as an online journal has grown into a powerful tool for building authority, growing an audience, and generating sustainable income. Whether you‚Äôre a solopreneur, side hustler, or small business owner, blogging is still one of the smartest ways to earn online. But success doesn‚Äôt come overnight‚Äîit takes strategy, consistency, and knowing what works today.

In this guide, we‚Äôll break down the path smart bloggers take to turn their writing into a steady source of income‚Äîand how you can do the same.

Why Blogging Still Works in 2025
Despite the explosion of video content and social media, blogging continues to thrive. Why? Because search engines still prioritize quality written content. People turn to Google every day with questions, and blogs that offer valuable answers continue to rise to the top.

According to a HubSpot study, businesses that blog get 55% more website visitors than those that don‚Äôt. This is especially important for American entrepreneurs looking to build authority in competitive niches.

Real-World Example: NerdWallet
NerdWallet, a personal finance company, built its multi-million-dollar brand primarily through blogging. By publishing SEO-optimized content that answered common money questions, it attracted millions of readers‚Äîand converted them into users of its affiliate partners and services.

trendingreddits,How to Prepare Americans for Upcoming Job Loss Due to AI,"As artificial intelligence (AI) continues to evolve, it‚Äôs becoming increasingly clear that its impact on the workforce will be profound. While AI promises greater efficiency, lower costs, and new industries, it also poses a significant threat to many traditional jobs‚Äîespecially those involving repetitive, rule-based tasks. For Americans, the challenge ahead isn‚Äôt just technological‚Äîit‚Äôs personal, economic, and cultural.


What Jobs Are Most at Risk?
Let‚Äôs be honest ‚Äî it‚Äôs the working class that‚Äôs getting hit first.
Not all jobs are equally vulnerable to AI automation. Roles that involve routine, repetitive tasks are the most at risk. So how can workers prepare for the AI-driven transformation of the labor market? Here‚Äôs a look at what‚Äôs coming, and what can be done about it. These include:

Administrative support (data entry, payroll, scheduling)

Transportation (drivers, delivery)

Retail and customer service

Basic manufacturing and warehouse jobs

Even white-collar jobs in finance, legal services, and journalism are starting to see AI encroach on tasks like report writing, contract analysis, and data interpretation.

The band was formed by musician Steven Wilson in 1987, and began essentially as a solo project for Wilson, who created all of the music. By December 1993, Wilson desired to work in a band environment, and so brought on frequent collaborators. The band has been on hiatus since 2010.

all,I traveled solo to Japan to 'find myself' and ended up having this quiet moment in Kyoto that I can‚Äôt stop thinking about,"Hey everyone,  
I‚Äôve been lurking here for a while and figured I‚Äôd finally share something from a recent trip. I just got back from three weeks in Japan, my first time traveling alone. I‚Äôm 26, recently single, and was feeling kind of stuck in life. Quit a job I hated, felt burnt out, and booked this trip hoping it would reset something in my brain.

And honestly, it did. But not in the way I expected.

Japan was incredible. I started in Tokyo, and the first night I just sat in a Lawson eating onigiri and felt like I was on another planet. It was loud and beautiful and confusing and amazing all at once. I kind of stumbled my way through the first week, but once I got used to it, I felt so free in a way I hadn‚Äôt in years.

The moment I want to share happened in Kyoto. I was trying to find this temple, Kiyomizu-dera, but my phone was on 4% and the directions were useless. I must‚Äôve looked super lost because this older woman walking a little white dog stopped and said something to me in Japanese. I just pointed at the temple on my map and kinda shrugged.

She smiled and motioned for me to follow her. I thought she‚Äôd just point me in the right direction, but she actually walked with me the whole way. Like, 15 or 20 minutes through these quiet little side streets. We didn‚Äôt speak the same language, but it wasn‚Äôt awkward. She pointed out a few little things along the way like flowers or shrines and smiled every time I looked confused or amazed.

Her dog kept checking behind to make sure I was still there, which was somehow the cutest thing I‚Äôve ever experienced.

When we got to the temple, I bowed and said thank you like five times. She just smiled, said something softly, and then turned around and walked back the way we came. Like it was nothing. Just helped a lost tourist without a second thought.

I don‚Äôt know. That moment has stayed with me more than any big tourist attraction. It was so simple, but so kind. I felt really seen in that moment, which was weird because we barely spoke.

Travel gives you these weird little memories that hit harder than you expect. I still think about her and her dog and that peaceful walk through Kyoto like it was a dream.

all,Update: AITAH for considering calling off my wedding because my fianc√©e refuses to sign a prenup after I found out she has a massive cedit card debt?,"it has been a tough few days for me after sharing my story here but I feel like I owe you guys an update about me situation so here it is

My first Post: I am just a middle aged man supposed to be getting married in a few months to my fianc√©e. We've been together for three years engaged for one and for most of that time I genuinely believed we were on the same page about life values and most importantly honesty. For background: I‚Äôve worked hard to build a stable financial foundation. I‚Äôm not wealth, but I own my home outright, have no personal debt and I‚Äôve been saving and investing since my early twenties. It‚Äôs been a priority for me especially since my parents went through a nasty divorce that ruined both of them financially. About a month ago, while we were discussing wedding costs, I brought up a prenup. Not in a cold or controlling way I just wanted to protect the life I‚Äôve worked hard to build. I was upfront that I‚Äôd still be fair and the agreement wouldn‚Äôt leave her with nothing. I expected an adult conversation. Instead she immediately got defensive. She said things like So you‚Äôre already planning for a divorce? and I thought we trusted each other. I tried to explain it wasn‚Äôt about trust it was about transparency and mutual protection. But she shut it down completely. That‚Äôs when red flags started popping up. She became evasive every time money came up and I started noticing weird things credit card offers in the mail, a few missed payments on shared expenses she said she'd cover, and lots of I'll handle it later energy.

So, I asked directly if she had debt. She admitted it. $92,000 in credit card debt. Not student loans. Not a mortgage. Credit cards. She said it accumulated over the years from unexpected expenses and a few dumb splurges but she never told me about any of it until I forced the issue. I was stunned. We‚Äôre about to merge lives. This woman was about to legally become my spouse and she didn‚Äôt think I deserved to know she was six figures in the red? I told her this made the prenup non-negotiable for me. I need to protect myself not just emotionally, but financially. I told her I was willing to still move forward but not without something in writing that protects my premarital assets. She lost it. Called me selfish. Said I was turning love into a business deal. Said my house and money should be hers too if we‚Äôre truly a team. Since then, she‚Äôs refused to talk about the prenup again and we‚Äôre barely speaking. Even her mother called me and accused me of humiliating her daughter and being materialistic. All I want is to not be liable for debt I didn‚Äôt create and to make sure the life I built before this relationship is protected. So now I‚Äôm seriously reconsidering the whole wedding. Not because she has debt but because she hid it then refused to take responsibility and now is treating me like the bad guy for trying to protect myself. I'm almost certain that she could pay her debts since she is a part partner in her friend's business but she just refuses to. AITAH for thinking about walking away?

My final update: so I wasn‚Äôt planning to come back, but a lot of people messaged me and honestly‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs been a hell of a few days. Figured I‚Äôd give an update. So yeah‚Ä¶ the wedding is officially off. After I posted I tried one more time to talk to my fianc√©e (well, ex now). I told her I wasn‚Äôt trying to be cold or controlling I just needed to protect myself. I also said that if the roles were reversed, I‚Äôd completely understand if she wanted to do the same. I told her I could still move forward with the wedding if we signed a fair prenup. One that clearly said her debt is hers and my home/savings are mine if things go bad. I also said I‚Äôd go to therapy or counseling with her if this felt like a deeper trust issue. She didn‚Äôt take it well. Said again that the prenup was an insult and I was basically planning for divorce. Then she started crying and said I was humiliating her and that I was destroying everything we had built over money. But that‚Äôs the thing it‚Äôs not just about the money. It‚Äôs about the fact that she kept a massive amount of debt hidden until she had no choice but to tell me. And even then, she only told me because I pushed for it. That‚Äôs not partnership, that‚Äôs avoidance. So I told her I couldn‚Äôt go through with it. I called off the wedding. It sucked. It still sucks. We told the venue canceled what we could and let people know. Her family is furious. Mine has been supportive but trying not to say I told you so. I‚Äôve lost a lot of money deposits suit some family flying in from out of state but honestly, that‚Äôs nothing compared to what could‚Äôve happened if I had ignored my gut.

She moved out two days ago. We‚Äôve barely spoken. I keep second-guessing myself, even now. I didn‚Äôt want this. But I also don‚Äôt want to wake up one day in financial ruin wondering why I ignored every red flag just to avoid hurting someone. Anyway, thanks for everyone who gave advice or just listened. I‚Äôm heartbroken, yeah, but I feel like I did the right thing. Doesn‚Äôt make it easy.

popular,AITAH for refusing to chip in for a coworker's wedding gift after literally being uninvited?,"Alright AITAH ppl, imma need your hot takes on this office drama that's been driving me insane

So I (27F) have been working at this marketing agency for about 2 years. My coworker Jess (31F) is getting married next month and initially invited our whole team (8 people) to her wedding. We're not like besties besties, but definitely friendly - lunch together sometimes, happy hours, the usual work friend stuff.

Last week our office manager Sarah started collecting money for a group gift. She's asking for $200 each which would get us some fancy kitchen gadget from their registry. That's basically what I'd budget for someone I'm actually friends with, but whatever, I was planning to contribute.

WELL. Yesterday I got the most awkward text from Jess saying they ""had to make some cuts to the guest list"" and unfortunately they couldn't accommodate me anymore. Something about venue capacity and family additions. But here's the kicker - I KNOW FOR A FACT that everyone else on our team is still invited!!! üôÉ

This morning Sarah comes by my desk asking for my contribution to the gift fund. I politely told her that since I'm no longer invited, I'd rather get Jess a smaller gift on my own. Sarah looked shocked and said ""but it's a team gift"" and that not contributing the full amount would ""mess up the group harmony"" (like I give a single fuck)

The icing on the cake? I know the wedding cut was because Jess invited her old coworker who just got a VP position at a major client. Suddenly there's ""no room"" for me, but I'm still expected to drop $200 on her registry? The thing is that (I'm not trying to brag whatsoever), but I literally hit a 5k win on Jackpotcity like last weekend so that $200 isn't even a big deal, but what she did to me specifically is something I ain't gonna tolerate

She smiled and motioned for me to follow her. I thought she‚Äôd just point me in the right direction, but she actually walked with me the whole way. Like, 15 or 20 minutes through these quiet little side streets. We didn‚Äôt speak the same language, but it wasn‚Äôt awkward. She pointed out a few little things along the way like flowers or shrines and smiled every time I looked confused or amazed.

Her dog kept checking behind to make sure I was still there, which was somehow the cutest thing I‚Äôve ever experienced.

When we got to the temple, I bowed and said thank you like five times. She just smiled, said something softly, and then turned around and walked back the way we came. Like it was nothing. Just helped a lost tourist without a second thought.

I don‚Äôt know. That moment has stayed with me more than any big tourist attraction. It was so simple, but so kind. I felt really seen in that moment, which was weird because we barely spoke.

Travel gives you these weird little memories that hit harder than you expect. I still think about her and her dog and that peaceful walk through Kyoto like it was a dream.

popular,Update: AITAH for considering calling off my wedding because my fianc√©e refuses to sign a prenup after I found out she has a massive cedit card debt?,"it has been a tough few days for me after sharing my story here but I feel like I owe you guys an update about me situation so here it is

My first Post: I am just a middle aged man supposed to be getting married in a few months to my fianc√©e. We've been together for three years engaged for one and for most of that time I genuinely believed we were on the same page about life values and most importantly honesty. For background: I‚Äôve worked hard to build a stable financial foundation. I‚Äôm not wealth, but I own my home outright, have no personal debt and I‚Äôve been saving and investing since my early twenties. It‚Äôs been a priority for me especially since my parents went through a nasty divorce that ruined both of them financially. About a month ago, while we were discussing wedding costs, I brought up a prenup. Not in a cold or controlling way I just wanted to protect the life I‚Äôve worked hard to build. I was upfront that I‚Äôd still be fair and the agreement wouldn‚Äôt leave her with nothing. I expected an adult conversation. Instead she immediately got defensive. She said things like So you‚Äôre already planning for a divorce? and I thought we trusted each other. I tried to explain it wasn‚Äôt about trust it was about transparency and mutual protection. But she shut it down completely. That‚Äôs when red flags started popping up. She became evasive every time money came up and I started noticing weird things credit card offers in the mail, a few missed payments on shared expenses she said she'd cover, and lots of I'll handle it later energy.

So, I asked directly if she had debt. She admitted it. $92,000 in credit card debt. Not student loans. Not a mortgage. Credit cards. She said it accumulated over the years from unexpected expenses and a few dumb splurges but she never told me about any of it until I forced the issue. I was stunned. We‚Äôre about to merge lives. This woman was about to legally become my spouse and she didn‚Äôt think I deserved to know she was six figures in the red? I told her this made the prenup non-negotiable for me. I need to protect myself not just emotionally, but financially. I told her I was willing to still move forward but not without something in writing that protects my premarital assets. She lost it. Called me selfish. Said I was turning love into a business deal. Said my house and money should be hers too if we‚Äôre truly a team. Since then, she‚Äôs refused to talk about the prenup again and we‚Äôre barely speaking. Even her mother called me and accused me of humiliating her daughter and being materialistic. All I want is to not be liable for debt I didn‚Äôt create and to make sure the life I built before this relationship is protected. So now I‚Äôm seriously reconsidering the whole wedding. Not because she has debt but because she hid it then refused to take responsibility and now is treating me like the bad guy for trying to protect myself. I'm almost certain that she could pay her debts since she is a part partner in her friend's business but she just refuses to. AITAH for thinking about walking away?

My final update: so I wasn‚Äôt planning to come back, but a lot of people messaged me and honestly‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs been a hell of a few days. Figured I‚Äôd give an update. So yeah‚Ä¶ the wedding is officially off. After I posted I tried one more time to talk to my fianc√©e (well, ex now). I told her I wasn‚Äôt trying to be cold or controlling I just needed to protect myself. I also said that if the roles were reversed, I‚Äôd completely understand if she wanted to do the same. I told her I could still move forward with the wedding if we signed a fair prenup. One that clearly said her debt is hers and my home/savings are mine if things go bad. I also said I‚Äôd go to therapy or counseling with her if this felt like a deeper trust issue. She didn‚Äôt take it well. Said again that the prenup was an insult and I was basically planning for divorce. Then she started crying and said I was humiliating her and that I was destroying everything we had built over money. But that‚Äôs the thing it‚Äôs not just about the money. It‚Äôs about the fact that she kept a massive amount of debt hidden until she had no choice but to tell me. And even then, she only told me because I pushed for it. That‚Äôs not partnership, that‚Äôs avoidance. So I told her I couldn‚Äôt go through with it. I called off the wedding. It sucked. It still sucks. We told the venue canceled what we could and let people know. Her family is furious. Mine has been supportive but trying not to say I told you so. I‚Äôve lost a lot of money deposits suit some family flying in from out of state but honestly, that‚Äôs nothing compared to what could‚Äôve happened if I had ignored my gut.

She moved out two days ago. We‚Äôve barely spoken. I keep second-guessing myself, even now. I didn‚Äôt want this. But I also don‚Äôt want to wake up one day in financial ruin wondering why I ignored every red flag just to avoid hurting someone. Anyway, thanks for everyone who gave advice or just listened. I‚Äôm heartbroken, yeah, but I feel like I did the right thing. Doesn‚Äôt make it easy.

popular,TIFU by losing my fiance over crypto,"So, yeah, I totally screwed up big time. Me and my fiance, Jess, been together 4 years, engaged for 1. Everything was great, we was planning our wedding, picking venues and all that. But then I got sucked into crypto, specifically Solana. I thought I was gonna be some genius investor, you know?

It started when I saw some X posts about memecoins, that they are like super fast, cheap fees, blah blah. I‚Äôm not rich, but I had like 10k saved up for the wedding. I figured, why not throw 5k into those coins? Make a quick buck, surprise Jess with a fancier honeymoon. I didn‚Äôt tell her, cause I wanted it to be a surprise.

Big mistake. i lost everything in the first few weeks. My 10k was gone. I was freaking out, couldn‚Äôt sleep. Jess noticed I was acting weird, kept asking what‚Äôs wrong. I didn‚Äôt wanna tell her I blew our wedding fund, so I lied, said it was work stress.

She found out anyway. I left my laptop open, and she saw the trading app, the red numbers, the whole mess. She flipped out, screaming how I gambled our future without even telling her. I tried to explain, said I‚Äôd make it back. She wasn‚Äôt having it. Said I broke her trust, acted like some sneaky addict. She gave me back the ring, packed a bag, and left to her mom‚Äôs.

That was 2 weeks ago. She‚Äôs barely talking to me, says she needs space.

Though in some years, I will earn well though. And I barely get time for going to parlour etc. As I just want to rest on Sundays. Note I am very well maintained girl and like to keep myself groomed, stylish. My bf 28m is civil engineer.

He was at my place and we got cosy. I am not super hairy, but had some hair down there. After we had fun, he told me he got disgusted by hair down there and why  am i not mainting my hygiene? Note I keep myself super clean and before we got cosy. I took bath and applied lotions. I asked did he smell something? He said those hair looks bad and he likes me smooth.

I got irritated and said his nose hair need to be trimmed,  because they look so big and I felt disgusted to kiss him, when they touched my lips. I told him he hasn't trimmed his chest hair in whole. They are touching his neck .

He got offended and isn't talking to me. But I won't apologise. He said i didn't smell bad. Then i told him he is super hairy and he should be mature enough to understand that I am not a p**n star to be hairless all the time.  Did i take it too far? Though this morning he has trimmed it all lmao. 

Though I like chest hair when they are not coming out of your shirt buttons.

Edit. People do your research. Having pubes doesn't equate to bring unhygienic. You have to keep it clean and you are well to go. And atleast I don't have back hair as well as countless hair all over the body. But I never shamed him for them

all,I just nuked all my design assets after my old agency stole years of my work,"About 5 years ago I worked as a graphic designer for a boutique marketing agency. They paid me barely above minimum wage despite charging clients premium rates for my work. I was fresh out of school, desperate for experience, and they knew it. I created hundreds of custom illustrations, logos, branding packages, and social media templates. I regularly worked 60+ hour weeks with no overtime. My portfolio grew impressive but my bank account didn't reflect it.

The toxic workplace was next level. The creative director would criticize work in front of clients to make herself look more valuable. Account managers would promise impossible timelines without consulting me, then blame me when deadlines were missed. After a year, I gathered my courage and asked for a raise, showing them how my designs had directly increased client retention and brought in referral business. They agreed I was ""valuable"" but said raises weren't in the budget. The next week, the owner bought a Tesla.

I quit two days later with no backup plan. It took months to find stable work, but I eventually landed at a company that respects my time and pays fairly. Yesterday, I discovered they were still using a portfolio site I had designed AND maintained under my personal domain. They never paid for these rights. Even worse, they were passing off newer designers' work as mine to leverage my reputation with former clients.

So I took screenshots as evidence, downloaded everything for my records, and deleted the entire site. I also changed all passwords and revoked their access to the premium font libraries I'd purchased with my own money. They're going to wake up to broken links, missing assets, and a lot of explaining to do to their clients.

popular,AITA for refusing to travel with my brother‚Äôs family because his kids only eat junk food?,"I (M39) am currently undergoing cancer treatment. In the end of it all, I am planning to take a holiday with a friend or family member to travel to the other side of the world. I am based in the UK and I am thinking Vietnam, South Korea, Japan or somewhere around there where I have never been. 

I asked my brother (M43) if he would consider coming with me. He got very excited and said his daughter (F12) and son (M8) would also come along. They are both incredibly picky eaters, and my niece only eats plain beige foods. She won‚Äôt even have a burger at McDonalds, just chips and nuggets, and that‚Äôs pretty much 80% of the kids‚Äô diet. I know my brother and his wife have tried hard to introduce them to other foods, but they just wont eat it. I love the two kids to bits, I really do. 

However, I want to travel to experience the food culture and that is a major part of it for me. I want to get off the beaten path and experience things in life I haven‚Äôt been brave enough to experience before. For me, selfishly, this trip is about the end of my cancer and celebrating that there is life after cancer. It‚Äôs also not something I can easily afford. 

This is where I might be the asshole. I asked my brother to come travel with me, and when he said his kids would come too, I told him I would rather travel with someone else. He is disappointed and angry with me, and frustrated that I don‚Äôt want to travel with his family. He feels I am being selfish as travelling with his children can also be fulfilling. I would also like to spend time with them and do some child friendly things during the holiday. 

He had already gotten my niece and nephew excited about the travel too. To make things worse, we live in different countries so we don‚Äôt see each other a lot. They will be very disappointed when they learn I have pulled the plug on the plans. I feel conflicted.

popular,Tomboys are a thing. Tired of being asked my sexuality or having it assumed just because of what I wear,"I'm a tomboy. No more , no less. I'm NOT gay. Or bi. Or queer. Or gender fluid . Or ""butch"" or whatever cute/catchy little buzzword is trending today. And I'm tired of being asked it every time I wear a t-shirt and jeans. I'm JUST a fucking tomboy. I wear what I want, WHEN I want. I WILL be comfortable. And clothes can't fuck. So they shouldn't give anyone any ideas of what I might be down for. But that's something that's been argued for a while even in the LGBTQ community. I've even heard people say that the term is offensive. Since when did that term become derogatory? Or 'offensive'? To WHO? I guess i understand since literally everything is ""offensive"" nowadays. 

I also hate that there don't seem to be anymore tomboy characters in tv/movies anymore, they just make them lesbian. Which is fine sometimes bc that absolutely needs representation too, but sometimes it comes across as lazy writing in my opinion. I feel like that could send the wrong message to kids in kids movies/tv; that every single girl that wears jeans instead of dresses is gay. Sure some might be and that's great.

Watching his press conference yesterday made me see a different side to him. I was shocked that he was clear and straight to the point.

Based on my quick google search, a PM‚Äôs salary is around C$400K, which is definitely a lot, but for someone with Carney‚Äôs background and experience, he could be making way more in the private sector with far less stress and without taking up the responsibility of leading an entire country.

This was only a viable strategy in og oblivion because the leveling system made it hard to achieve a perfect level up when using multiple skills. In og oblivion you could easily mess a build up by leveling at the wrong time and only getting a +3 to your main attributes.

all,AITAH for refusing to give my boyfriend children because he won‚Äôt marry me,"My boyfriend (33m) and I (31f) have been dating for seven years. Early on we talked about marriage, kids, a house, the whole shebang. 

I like kids and I think I‚Äôd be a good mother. I‚Äôd like to have children but I wouldn‚Äôt be upset if I didn‚Äôt have any. I‚Äôm happy with my life as is, and I could be happy with children as well. My boyfriend has always dreamed of being a dad, and recently suggested that we‚Äôre in the  place to start trying for some.  

I was a little confused by this. I told him early on, within the first year, that I would never have children with a man that I‚Äôm not married to. I feel like children are a much bigger commitment than marriage, so marriage should come first. Additionally, if a man doesn‚Äôt love me and isn‚Äôt committed enough to spending the rest of our lives together, I don‚Äôt see why I wouldn‚Äôt make the sacrifice of bearing his children? Maybe it‚Äôs old fashioned of me. I explained all of this to him, once again. 

He was awkward, and said he just doesn‚Äôt want to get married. He said men get screwed over in divorces all the time, and he just doesn‚Äôt think marriage is important or a smart choice. 

I said that‚Äôs fine. We don‚Äôt have to get married. I‚Äôm happy with our life as is. We just won‚Äôt be buying a house together or having children together. We can each buy our own house and live in one, and rent out the other. If we aren‚Äôt getting married I don‚Äôt want to really entangle our finances in any way. 

He blew up at me and said I‚Äôm punishing him for not waiting to marry him. I said I‚Äôm not, just that having children outside of marriage goes outside of my personal values. 

I also told him that since he‚Äôs super against the idea of marriage I am not going to marry him just for a shut up ring, that he only gives me because he wants kids. I want him to actually want to marry me, and if not, that‚Äôs okay. Children and marriage are off the table for us. If he wants kids now he needs to leave me and find someone who will have kids for him without expecting any stability in return. And maybe I could find someone who wants to marry me, and maybe or maybe not have kids. I said all of this to him. 

He‚Äôs been very distressed and emotionally distraught. He has a disease that very much so limits his life expectancy. He has said that if he doesn‚Äôt have kids asap he probably shouldn‚Äôt have them at all, because otherwise he wouldn‚Äôt be able to see them into adulthood.

popular,She erased us from her wedding. So I‚Äôm erasing her from mine.,"When my brother got married, his bride (now my sister-in-law) had very specific expectations. She wanted everyone in the family to wear their wedding colors, and we all did. People flew in from out of state. Everyone made an effort to make her feel celebrated.

The day before the wedding, she made some offhanded (but clearly pointed) remarks about how ‚Äúour side‚Äù of the family never takes anything seriously and she wasn‚Äôt expecting us to take this seriously either. The comments made their rounds, and feelings were hurt before the wedding even began. But we still showed up, looked great, and participated.

Fast forward to getting the wedding photos and video: not a single photo of our side of the family was posted. Not one. In the entire 3-minute highlight reel? No faces from our family, except a 3-second clip of my parents with the bride and groom. The rest of us? It‚Äôs like we never existed.

I texted her (cordially) and asked if she could send me the pictures with just our siblings, since none had been posted. She responded that we never took those pictures. That‚Äôs wild because I remember helping people adjust corsages for them. She doubled down on the gaslighting. I gave it six months and asked again‚Äîshe suddenly had no idea what I was talking about.

Fine.

Here‚Äôs where the petty revenge comes in.

I‚Äôm getting married in 8 days. I‚Äôve been engaged for 6 months and planning this moment since she tried to erase us. I hired a great photographer and videographer. What she doesn‚Äôt know is that the videographer has a secret mission: make it look like she‚Äôs getting all the attention. Track her. Hover near her like she‚Äôs the star of the show. She will feel so seen.

And then‚Ä¶ the final cut?

She won‚Äôt appear for even one second. Just like she made sure we didn‚Äôt.

I didn‚Äôt even invite her originally. Word must‚Äôve gotten out because she cornered me at a family dinner and said, ‚ÄúUnfortunately I have to work the day before and after your wedding, but I should still be able to make it.‚Äù I was so stunned I just said, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs fine. The Airbnb is booked whether you‚Äôre there or not.‚Äù So now she‚Äôs coming. Ugh.

To cope? I spelled her name wrong on the wedding invite on purpose. That was my first move. The video blackout will be my last.

Not asking for advice. Not asking if it‚Äôs ‚Äútoo mean.‚Äù It‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs exactly fair.

popular,Update: AITAH for considering calling off my wedding because my fianc√©e refuses to sign a prenup after I found out she has a massive cedit card debt?,"it has been a tough few days for me after sharing my story here but I feel like I owe you guys an update about me situation so here it is

My first Post: I am just a middle aged man supposed to be getting married in a few months to my fianc√©e. We've been together for three years engaged for one and for most of that time I genuinely believed we were on the same page about life values and most importantly honesty. For background: I‚Äôve worked hard to build a stable financial foundation. I‚Äôm not wealth, but I own my home outright, have no personal debt and I‚Äôve been saving and investing since my early twenties. It‚Äôs been a priority for me especially since my parents went through a nasty divorce that ruined both of them financially. About a month ago, while we were discussing wedding costs, I brought up a prenup. Not in a cold or controlling way I just wanted to protect the life I‚Äôve worked hard to build. I was upfront that I‚Äôd still be fair and the agreement wouldn‚Äôt leave her with nothing. I expected an adult conversation. Instead she immediately got defensive. She said things like So you‚Äôre already planning for a divorce? and I thought we trusted each other. I tried to explain it wasn‚Äôt about trust it was about transparency and mutual protection. But she shut it down completely. That‚Äôs when red flags started popping up. She became evasive every time money came up and I started noticing weird things credit card offers in the mail, a few missed payments on shared expenses she said she'd cover, and lots of I'll handle it later energy.

So, I asked directly if she had debt. She admitted it. $92,000 in credit card debt. Not student loans. Not a mortgage. Credit cards. She said it accumulated over the years from unexpected expenses and a few dumb splurges but she never told me about any of it until I forced the issue. I was stunned. We‚Äôre about to merge lives. This woman was about to legally become my spouse and she didn‚Äôt think I deserved to know she was six figures in the red? I told her this made the prenup non-negotiable for me. I need to protect myself not just emotionally, but financially. I told her I was willing to still move forward but not without something in writing that protects my premarital assets. She lost it. Called me selfish. Said I was turning love into a business deal. Said my house and money should be hers too if we‚Äôre truly a team. Since then, she‚Äôs refused to talk about the prenup again and we‚Äôre barely speaking. Even her mother called me and accused me of humiliating her daughter and being materialistic. All I want is to not be liable for debt I didn‚Äôt create and to make sure the life I built before this relationship is protected. So now I‚Äôm seriously reconsidering the whole wedding. Not because she has debt but because she hid it then refused to take responsibility and now is treating me like the bad guy for trying to protect myself. I'm almost certain that she could pay her debts since she is a part partner in her friend's business but she just refuses to. AITAH for thinking about walking away?

My final update: so I wasn‚Äôt planning to come back, but a lot of people messaged me and honestly‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs been a hell of a few days. Figured I‚Äôd give an update. So yeah‚Ä¶ the wedding is officially off. After I posted I tried one more time to talk to my fianc√©e (well, ex now). I told her I wasn‚Äôt trying to be cold or controlling I just needed to protect myself. I also said that if the roles were reversed, I‚Äôd completely understand if she wanted to do the same. I told her I could still move forward with the wedding if we signed a fair prenup. One that clearly said her debt is hers and my home/savings are mine if things go bad. I also said I‚Äôd go to therapy or counseling with her if this felt like a deeper trust issue. She didn‚Äôt take it well. Said again that the prenup was an insult and I was basically planning for divorce. Then she started crying and said I was humiliating her and that I was destroying everything we had built over money. But that‚Äôs the thing it‚Äôs not just about the money. It‚Äôs about the fact that she kept a massive amount of debt hidden until she had no choice but to tell me. And even then, she only told me because I pushed for it. That‚Äôs not partnership, that‚Äôs avoidance. So I told her I couldn‚Äôt go through with it. I called off the wedding. It sucked. It still sucks. We told the venue canceled what we could and let people know. Her family is furious. Mine has been supportive but trying not to say I told you so. I‚Äôve lost a lot of money deposits suit some family flying in from out of state but honestly, that‚Äôs nothing compared to what could‚Äôve happened if I had ignored my gut.

She moved out two days ago. We‚Äôve barely spoken. I keep second-guessing myself, even now. I didn‚Äôt want this. But I also don‚Äôt want to wake up one day in financial ruin wondering why I ignored every red flag just to avoid hurting someone. Anyway, thanks for everyone who gave advice or just listened. I‚Äôm heartbroken, yeah, but I feel like I did the right thing. Doesn‚Äôt make it easy.

popular,AITA for refusing to travel with my brother‚Äôs family because his kids only eat junk food?,"I (M39) am currently undergoing cancer treatment. In the end of it all, I am planning to take a holiday with a friend or family member to travel to the other side of the world. I am based in the UK and I am thinking Vietnam, South Korea, Japan or somewhere around there where I have never been. 

I asked my brother (M43) if he would consider coming with me. He got very excited and said his daughter (F12) and son (M8) would also come along. They are both incredibly picky eaters, and my niece only eats plain beige foods. She won‚Äôt even have a burger at McDonalds, just chips and nuggets, and that‚Äôs pretty much 80% of the kids‚Äô diet. I know my brother and his wife have tried hard to introduce them to other foods, but they just wont eat it. I love the two kids to bits, I really do. 

However, I want to travel to experience the food culture and that is a major part of it for me. I want to get off the beaten path and experience things in life I haven‚Äôt been brave enough to experience before. For me, selfishly, this trip is about the end of my cancer and celebrating that there is life after cancer. It‚Äôs also not something I can easily afford. 

This is where I might be the asshole. I asked my brother to come travel with me, and when he said his kids would come too, I told him I would rather travel with someone else. He is disappointed and angry with me, and frustrated that I don‚Äôt want to travel with his family. He feels I am being selfish as travelling with his children can also be fulfilling. I would also like to spend time with them and do some child friendly things during the holiday. 

He had already gotten my niece and nephew excited about the travel too. To make things worse, we live in different countries so we don‚Äôt see each other a lot. They will be very disappointed when they learn I have pulled the plug on the plans. I feel conflicted.

So, AITA?",4514.0,1093.0,2025-05-03 12:22:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1kdrpp6/aita_for_refusing_to_travel_with_my_brothers/,aita refuse travel brother family kid eat junk food,16,89,5.5625,0.0,1.0,m39 currently undergo cancer treatment end plan take holiday friend family member travel side world base uk think vietnam south korea japan somewhere around never ask brother m43 would consider come get excite say daughter f12 son m8 would come along incredibly picky eater niece eat plain beige food even burger mcdonalds chip nugget pretty much 80 kid diet know brother wife try hard introduce food wont eat love two kid bit really however want travel experience food culture major part want get beat path experience thing life brave enough experience selfishly trip end cancer celebrate life cancer not something easily afford might asshole ask brother come travel say kid would come tell would rather travel someone else disappoint angry frustrate want travel family feel selfish travel child fulfil would like spend time child friendly thing holiday already get niece nephew excite travel make thing worse live different country see lot disappoint learn pull plug plan feel conflict aita,360,1881,5.225,-0.017366264687693256,0.6431122448979593,0.04522926524589194
popular,I just nuked all my design assets after my old agency stole years of my work,"About 5 years ago I worked as a graphic designer for a boutique marketing agency. They paid me barely above minimum wage despite charging clients premium rates for my work. I was fresh out of school, desperate for experience, and they knew it. I created hundreds of custom illustrations, logos, branding packages, and social media templates. I regularly worked 60+ hour weeks with no overtime. My portfolio grew impressive but my bank account didn't reflect it.

The toxic workplace was next level. The creative director would criticize work in front of clients to make herself look more valuable. Account managers would promise impossible timelines without consulting me, then blame me when deadlines were missed. After a year, I gathered my courage and asked for a raise, showing them how my designs had directly increased client retention and brought in referral business. They agreed I was ""valuable"" but said raises weren't in the budget. The next week, the owner bought a Tesla.

I quit two days later with no backup plan. It took months to find stable work, but I eventually landed at a company that respects my time and pays fairly. Yesterday, I discovered they were still using a portfolio site I had designed AND maintained under my personal domain. They never paid for these rights. Even worse, they were passing off newer designers' work as mine to leverage my reputation with former clients.

So I took screenshots as evidence, downloaded everything for my records, and deleted the entire site. I also changed all passwords and revoked their access to the premium font libraries I'd purchased with my own money. They're going to wake up to broken links, missing assets, and a lot of explaining to do to their clients.

popular,Tomboys are a thing. Tired of being asked my sexuality or having it assumed just because of what I wear,"I'm a tomboy. No more , no less. I'm NOT gay. Or bi. Or queer. Or gender fluid . Or ""butch"" or whatever cute/catchy little buzzword is trending today. And I'm tired of being asked it every time I wear a t-shirt and jeans. I'm JUST a fucking tomboy. I wear what I want, WHEN I want. I WILL be comfortable. And clothes can't fuck. So they shouldn't give anyone any ideas of what I might be down for. But that's something that's been argued for a while even in the LGBTQ community. I've even heard people say that the term is offensive. Since when did that term become derogatory? Or 'offensive'? To WHO? I guess i understand since literally everything is ""offensive"" nowadays. 

I also hate that there don't seem to be anymore tomboy characters in tv/movies anymore, they just make them lesbian. Which is fine sometimes bc that absolutely needs representation too, but sometimes it comes across as lazy writing in my opinion. I feel like that could send the wrong message to kids in kids movies/tv; that every single girl that wears jeans instead of dresses is gay. Sure some might be and that's great.

popular,Carney‚Äôs salary cut to become PM,"I‚Äôll be honest.. I didn‚Äôt vote for Carney. I had my doubts because of the last 2 liberal terms. On top of that, the whole ‚Äúglobal elite banker turned politician‚Äù narrative didn‚Äôt give me the greatest impression. I wasn‚Äôt convinced he would try to help regular hard working Canadians.

Watching his press conference yesterday made me see a different side to him. I was shocked that he was clear and straight to the point. 

From a finance perspective, it dawned on me that he probably took a massive pay cut to become PM. Based on my quick google search, a PM‚Äôs salary is around C$400K, which is definitely a lot, but for someone with Carney‚Äôs background and experience, he could be making way more in the private sector with far less stress and without taking up the responsibility of leading an entire country.

popular,Stop under leveling yourself in the remaster,"I see alot of players min maxing, attempting to only use 2/3 skills to keep their character from ""overleveling"" 

This was only a viable strategy in og oblivion because the leveling system made it hard to achieve a perfect level up when using multiple skills. In og oblivion you could easily mess a build up by leveling at the wrong time and only getting a +3 to your main attributes.  

The remaster fixed this and gives you 12 attribute points to spend how you please on every level up regardless of what skills you used to get to that level.

trendingreddits,How To Guide | The Smart Blogger‚Äôs Path to a Steady Online Income,"Blogging isn‚Äôt dead‚Äîit‚Äôs evolved. What once began as an online journal has grown into a powerful tool for building authority, growing an audience, and generating sustainable income. Whether you‚Äôre a solopreneur, side hustler, or small business owner, blogging is still one of the smartest ways to earn online. But success doesn‚Äôt come overnight‚Äîit takes strategy, consistency, and knowing what works today.

In this guide, we‚Äôll break down the path smart bloggers take to turn their writing into a steady source of income‚Äîand how you can do the same.

Why Blogging Still Works in 2025
Despite the explosion of video content and social media, blogging continues to thrive. Why? Because search engines still prioritize quality written content. People turn to Google every day with questions, and blogs that offer valuable answers continue to rise to the top.

According to a HubSpot study, businesses that blog get 55% more website visitors than those that don‚Äôt. This is especially important for American entrepreneurs looking to build authority in competitive niches.

Real-World Example: NerdWallet
NerdWallet, a personal finance company, built its multi-million-dollar brand primarily through blogging. By publishing SEO-optimized content that answered common money questions, it attracted millions of readers‚Äîand converted them into users of its affiliate partners and services.

While AI promises greater efficiency, lower costs, and new industries, it also poses a significant threat to many traditional jobs‚Äîespecially those involving repetitive, rule-based tasks. For Americans, the challenge ahead isn‚Äôt just technological‚Äîit‚Äôs personal, economic, and cultural.


What Jobs Are Most at Risk?
Let‚Äôs be honest ‚Äî it‚Äôs the working class that‚Äôs getting hit first.
Not all jobs are equally vulnerable to AI automation. Roles that involve routine, repetitive tasks are the most at risk. So how can workers prepare for the AI-driven transformation of the labor market? Here‚Äôs a look at what‚Äôs coming, and what can be done about it. These include:

Administrative support (data entry, payroll, scheduling)

Transportation (drivers, delivery)

Retail and customer service

Basic manufacturing and warehouse jobs

Even white-collar jobs in finance, legal services, and journalism are starting to see AI encroach on tasks like report writing, contract analysis, and data interpretation.

Porcupine Tree is unquestionably one of the most difficult-to-categorize and innovative rock bands of all time. The band was formed by musician Steven Wilson in 1987, and began essentially as a solo project for Wilson, who created all of the music. By December 1993, Wilson desired to work in a band environment, and so brought on frequent collaborators. The band has been on hiatus since 2010.

Who emerged to find Jesus. Who was written off as a has-been by the end of the '80s and who suddenly shifted gears, releasing some of the strongest music of his career beginning in the late '90s.

This is a subforum supporting a community that avoids that filthy fifth glyph. Individuals in this community can post anything as long that fifth symbol of our ABC's is totally missing. This task can look daunting at first but it is not as hard as it looks. This is an arduous skill, it is not a trivial task. 

Join us and try posting a translation of that Rick Roll song in our quad-monthly translation trials.

all,"Whistleblowing in Federal IT: What I Did, Why It Matters, and How You Can Speak Up Safely","Hi FedNews, 

I‚Äôm a federal IT specialist who, about two weeks ago, filed a formal disclosure with Congress about a potential major security incident inside my agency and asked for an investigation. 
I‚Äôm posting to remind every public servant that speaking up matters and you‚Äôre not alone. You should feel empowered. Transparency is key.

What happened at a high level.
* Noticed some odd metrics
* Gathered data and built reports
* Reported internally 
* Escalated chain of command
* Disclosed to Congress

(NPR and KrebsOnSecurity have the full timeline and more details. Also, the disclosure is public. https://whistlebloweraid.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025_0414_Berulis-Disclosure-with-Exhibits.s.pdf )


As to why I spoke up when internal reporting failed‚Ä¶

I loved my job, my team, my agency, our mission, and the opportunity to serve the people of this great nation. When internal channels stalled, I weighed my clearance, paycheck, and career against the potential national impact of staying silent. The country‚Äôs cybersecurity, and the public‚Äôs trust, were worth the risk. If fear mutes us, we fail our oath. Fear and apathy are the death of democracy.


Lessons learned..

1) Document everything. Conversations, metrics, screenshots, ticket numbers, timestamps. Use only work devices; keep classified data classified.


2) Use protected channels first. IG hotlines, CISA US-CERT, or cleared counsel. Escalate only if stonewalled or compromised.


3) Know your rights. 5 U.S.C. ¬ß 7211 guarantees a direct path to Congress. Invoke it precisely.


4) Build a support net early. Line up legal help, trusted colleagues, and friends/family to keep you grounded.


5) Take safety seriously. Check your car, install cameras/alarms, vary routines, lock down your digital life. They seem dramatic,  until they aren't.


6) Guard your mental health. Stress is real; therapy, exercise, or simply talking helps.


I chose to attach my name because I stand behind my actions and welcome open debate. You don‚Äôt have to; there are secure, anonymous avenues.


Closing thought

Each of us entered public service to uphold the Constitution and serve millions who may never know our names. That duty runs deeper than politics or fear. We all know the difference between right and wrong. If something at your agency keeps you up at night, don‚Äôt hope the storm passes and keep your head down. Gather the facts, protect yourself, and speak up. Duty is hardest when it matters most, which is exactly why it matters most.

- Dan

all,My mortgage is completely paid off!,"Yesterday was my last mortgage payment (and it was just a fraction of what I paid every week--$90 instead of $450). I (55 3/4 F) bought the house on my own in 2008. I paid the mortgage every week long before I got married, then as the primary/only breadwinner afterwards. And I'm both proud & relieved to be done.

Here's where the old person yelling comes in. Television trained me to believe that there would be some kind of document that I could burn to mark the milestone. There isn't (yet? Maybe I'll get some kind of doc from the bank in the mail?).

Instead, as I do all my banking online, and the payment comes out at the end of the day, I had to look at that $90 balance for days and days. Then this morning, I logged in hoping to see the account balance at zero. My plan was to screenshot it and send it to those in my life who'd celebrate with me, virtually. 

And yet... log in and the account was gone! Not zero, but disappeared. I'm happy it's gone, but I feel shafted on the celebratory experience. Any other GenXers let down by hitting this milestone without anything to bote it?

Stop calling them maga.  They are Russians influencers.


You people are so obsessed with your conspiracy theories you will do anything in your power to avoid actual research and see you‚Äôre parroting Russian bullshit . If you even just looked deeper into where the theories you believe are coming from you would realize it's not anywhere near as trustworthy as you think. Like if you actually looked at how hateful you‚Äôve become.  How unAmerican you are.

 And you'd see all the cult tactics being used on you.  1) make you mistrust media.   You‚Äôll only get correct information from one source.  2). Isolate you.  3). Give you a mission.  Something that‚Äôll make you lose your identity. ‚Äúsave the babies‚Äù.  4) Give you an enemy to focus on.  ‚ÄúDems, left, libs?   5).  ‚ÄúSave the babies.  Save the babies.‚Äù Or whatever motto is used over and over and over.   6). Give you a savior and he is the only person that can solve it.   
It‚Äôs common brainwashing and cult tactics. Everyone knows this but you. 

You‚Äôre being used.  And it will one day turn on you. 

But no, you'd never do that, because that's less fun and less hateful. And you'll still act super smug about it like you know something everyone else doesn't but really you're just super ignorant and brainwashed and proud of it.  

You  believe this shit cause you want to.  

Jesus was about mutual love 
Your movement is about mutual hate
You‚Äôre in a hate group.  Wake the fuck up
They want you asleep   Not woke.  So they can brainwash you.  

You are no longer Americans.  You are Russian influencers. 

You want to burn this country to the ground just so you can rule over the ashes.

all,AITAH for not selling my neighbor a thrifted rocking chair I JUST BOUGHT?,"I honestly have no words.  I (27)  just bought my house in july 2024.  We have learned that most of the neighbors are all old as hell.( i think these neighbors are 60s +) and are very nosey and onery that young families are moving into the neighborhood in recent years. They will just walk up to you and tell you this. 

I have been shopping thrift and estate sales to furnish this cute house. This morning, I came home from an estate sale with a BEAUTIFUL wingbacked rocking chair. (It needs to be reuplostered as the leather that was on it is in terrible condition and the previous owner started pulling it off. ) 

Im unloading it from the bed of my truck when neighbor , Carol,  sticks her giraffe neck over the fence and starts squawking about how beautiful it is . I said thanks i got it at an estate sale for $10! This triggered the parasites in her brain and she, i shit you not, teleported over to the truck. She starts going off about how much she needs a chair to rock her grandkids to sleep in and how much she would appreciate it if it was hers. I told her I got it for my future babies to be rocked to sleep in and that it still  needs lots of work before it can be used. Mind you this chair is large and she is very small. 

This is when she starts offering me money ($15 because "" its more than what you paid for it"") then telling me i dont need it because i dont have kids yet and her grandkids are only little for so long. After firmly telling her i wasn't interested in selling it, she offered me $20. 

I was standing in the bed of the truck looking down at her on the driveway and said ""No, Carol im really not interested in selling this. Please go home."" And pointed to her side of the fence. Apparently this was shouting at her and being aggressive.  

She ran home and later in the day her husband said something to my husband as he was getting home from a game.  Telling him i was being  a ""nasty neighbor"" and that my husband needs to ""straighten me out.""  

Are my neighbors nuts? Was I that rude to her? Also, if perhaps their house accidentally burns down, it for sure wasnt me.

all,My cousin named her daughter ‚ÄòSiobhan‚Äô but insists it‚Äôs pronounced ‚ÄòSee-oh-banny‚Äô,"I try really hard to keep my mouth shut when it comes to baby names, especially with my family, because everyone‚Äôs got feelings and you can‚Äôt say a damn thing without it becoming a generational feud. But this one‚Ä¶ this one broke me.

My cousin (born and raised in suburban Texas, hasn‚Äôt left the country except for one all inclusive in Cancun) recently had a baby girl. She proudly announced at the baby shower that they‚Äôd chosen an ‚Äúauthentic Irish name‚Äù because she ‚Äújust loves the vibe of Celtic stuff‚Äù (her words, not mine). The name? Siobhan. What is an Irish name? Yes. [That my cousin spends all day hooked on this? Also, 100%. Some inspiration would come from both things.](https://aitah.click/obprrh)

Okay, cool. Classic name. Beautiful, if you say it right.

But then she said it out loud: ‚ÄúSee-oh-banny.‚Äù

I blinked. I thought maybe she was joking. I said, gently, ‚ÄúOh, you mean Shiv-awn, right?‚Äù She looked at me like I had insulted her child‚Äôs soul. ‚ÄúNo. It‚Äôs See-oh-banny. That‚Äôs how we say it.‚Äù

I tried to explain that Irish spelling doesn‚Äôt work the same as English phonetics, that names like Siobhan or Niamh or Aoife look confusing but have established pronunciations. She just doubled down. ‚ÄúWell, I think it‚Äôs more beautiful our way. We‚Äôre making it our own.‚Äù

She then went on a small rant about how the name should evolve ‚Äúwith the culture‚Äù and how America has ‚Äúits own version of Irish now.‚Äù I‚Äôm still not sure what that means. I tried one more time, just for the child‚Äôs future sanity. ‚ÄúYou know, Siobhan is pronounced Shiv-awn in Ireland, so maybe she‚Äôll want to know that when she‚Äôs older‚Äù

She cut me off. ‚ÄúWell, this is America. And in America, it‚Äôs See-oh-banny.‚Äù

So now there‚Äôs a baby out there named ‚ÄúSee-oh-banny,‚Äù who will one day be very confused when she tries to buy a keychain in Dublin.",2653.0,394.0,2025-05-03 23:25:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/tragedeigh/comments/1ke62rt/my_cousin_named_her_daughter_siobhan_but_insists/,cousin name daughter siobhan insist pronounce see oh banny,11,81,7.363636363636363,0.0,0.0,try really hard keep mouth shut come baby name especially family everyone get feeling say damn thing without become generational feud one one break cousin bear raise suburban texas leave country except one inclusive cancun recently baby girl proudly announce baby shower choose authentic irish name love vibe celtic stuff word not mine name siobhan irish name yes cousin spend day hook 100 inspiration would come thing okay cool classic name beautiful say right say loud see oh banny blink think maybe joke say gently oh mean shiv awn right look like insult child soul no see oh banny say try explain irish spell work english phonetics name like siobhan niamh aoife look confuse establish pronunciation double well think beautiful way make go small rant name evolve culture america version irish still not sure mean try one time child future sanity know siobhan pronounce shiv awn ireland maybe want know older cut well america america see oh banny baby name see oh banny one day confuse try buy keychain dublin,319,1827,5.7272727272727275,0.15347332451499118,0.4982881393298061,0.027740858510592797

popular,AITA for refusing to travel with my brother‚Äôs family because his kids only eat junk food?,"I (M39) am currently undergoing cancer treatment. In the end of it all, I am planning to take a holiday with a friend or family member to travel to the other side of the world. I am based in the UK and I am thinking Vietnam, South Korea, Japan or somewhere around there where I have never been. 

I asked my brother (M43) if he would consider coming with me. He got very excited and said his daughter (F12) and son (M8) would also come along. They are both incredibly picky eaters, and my niece only eats plain beige foods. She won‚Äôt even have a burger at McDonalds, just chips and nuggets, and that‚Äôs pretty much 80% of the kids‚Äô diet. I know my brother and his wife have tried hard to introduce them to other foods, but they just wont eat it. I love the two kids to bits, I really do. 

However, I want to travel to experience the food culture and that is a major part of it for me. I want to get off the beaten path and experience things in life I haven‚Äôt been brave enough to experience before. For me, selfishly, this trip is about the end of my cancer and celebrating that there is life after cancer. It‚Äôs also not something I can easily afford. 

This is where I might be the asshole. I asked my brother to come travel with me, and when he said his kids would come too, I told him I would rather travel with someone else. He is disappointed and angry with me, and frustrated that I don‚Äôt want to travel with his family. He feels I am being selfish as travelling with his children can also be fulfilling. I would also like to spend time with them and do some child friendly things during the holiday. 

He had already gotten my niece and nephew excited about the travel too. To make things worse, we live in different countries so we don‚Äôt see each other a lot. They will be very disappointed when they learn I have pulled the plug on the plans. I feel conflicted.

So, AITA? 

ETA: I am currently having cancer treatment. I only just started. I have grade 3, stage 3 thyroid cancer that is spread to cervical spine. I have chemo now, started first round, and then surgery, then more chemo and then radio. The travel won‚Äôt be until late 2026 at the earliest (god willing).

She ran home and later in the day her husband said something to my husband as he was getting home from a game.  Telling him i was being  a ""nasty neighbor"" and that my husband needs to ""straighten me out.""  

Are my neighbors nuts? Was I that rude to her? Also, if perhaps their house accidentally burns down, it for sure wasnt me.

popular,People driving around Ontario with ‚ÄúF Carney‚Äù flags - why?!,"I‚Äôm hoping to get some genuine insight from anybody that has made the expedient brand pivot. I have my own theories and understanding of why but I‚Äôm hoping to hear supporters of the idea articulate it.

While I never agreed with the ‚ÄúF Trudeau‚Äù flags, I could better understand why people did it. From the moment he took office, he made a certain ideology his brand and part of his leading and legislating. I get the perception that he made statements that felt like attacks to some, i can see how you‚Äôd interpret some of his choices as ‚Äúforced‚Äù DEI more than any other leader in Canadian history has ever done. Then covid hit and he took more on the chin than anybody, especially when it came to provincial mandates.

I don‚Äôt get the Carney hate though. I can see not liking him, sure. I can see a particular party allegiance. But he‚Äôs a stoic, pragmatic, economic leader. *He‚Äôs what conservatives drool over*. He‚Äôs barely had any time to make any changes, and the changes he has made should be seen as positives to anybody that hated Trudeau before him. He made a large, thoughtful and very elaborate policy platform and made stronger efforts to address Canadians largest complaints more than anybody and it certainly seems like it‚Äôs more than just talk.

So‚Ä¶ why? Don‚Äôt you think the immediate pivot from *Trudeau is evil* to *Carney is evil* kind of delegitimizes ten years of effort against a certain populist? Don‚Äôt you think people are going to take you even less serious now?

I‚Äôll speak honestly, I was embarrassed by the ‚ÄúF Trudeau‚Äù flags and stickers, but I lived with them. From the perspective of a normie (somewhat at least?) this ‚ÄúF Carney‚Äù stuff is just embarrassing Americanized garbage and maybe if you don‚Äôt have a reasonable answer for the immediate pivot, it‚Äôs time to consider a little reflection?

Edit: a lot of opinions from people that share my views in one way or another‚Ä¶ the most elaborate attempt at answers from people that want to defend it contain multiple conspiracies‚Ä¶.

popular,AITAH for refusing to give my boyfriend children because he won‚Äôt marry me,"My boyfriend (33m) and I (31f) have been dating for seven years. Early on we talked about marriage, kids, a house, the whole shebang. 

I like kids and I think I‚Äôd be a good mother. I‚Äôd like to have children but I wouldn‚Äôt be upset if I didn‚Äôt have any. I‚Äôm happy with my life as is, and I could be happy with children as well. My boyfriend has always dreamed of being a dad, and recently suggested that we‚Äôre in the  place to start trying for some.  

I was a little confused by this. I told him early on, within the first year, that I would never have children with a man that I‚Äôm not married to. I feel like children are a much bigger commitment than marriage, so marriage should come first. Additionally, if a man doesn‚Äôt love me and isn‚Äôt committed enough to spending the rest of our lives together, I don‚Äôt see why I wouldn‚Äôt make the sacrifice of bearing his children? Maybe it‚Äôs old fashioned of me. I explained all of this to him, once again. 

He was awkward, and said he just doesn‚Äôt want to get married. He said men get screwed over in divorces all the time, and he just doesn‚Äôt think marriage is important or a smart choice. 

I said that‚Äôs fine. We don‚Äôt have to get married. I‚Äôm happy with our life as is. We just won‚Äôt be buying a house together or having children together. We can each buy our own house and live in one, and rent out the other. If we aren‚Äôt getting married I don‚Äôt want to really entangle our finances in any way. 

He blew up at me and said I‚Äôm punishing him for not waiting to marry him. I said I‚Äôm not, just that having children outside of marriage goes outside of my personal values. 

I also told him that since he‚Äôs super against the idea of marriage I am not going to marry him just for a shut up ring, that he only gives me because he wants kids. I want him to actually want to marry me, and if not, that‚Äôs okay. Children and marriage are off the table for us. If he wants kids now he needs to leave me and find someone who will have kids for him without expecting any stability in return. And maybe I could find someone who wants to marry me, and maybe or maybe not have kids. I said all of this to him. 

He‚Äôs been very distressed and emotionally distraught. He has a disease that very much so limits his life expectancy. He has said that if he doesn‚Äôt have kids asap he probably shouldn‚Äôt have them at all, because otherwise he wouldn‚Äôt be able to see them into adulthood.

all,I've been stealing parking from my work every day for months,"My work charges $10/day for parking in the parking garage, which really adds up. We are supposed to pay this out of our own pockets. But I don't pay.

I found a parking spot on the bottom floor of the garage that is all the way in the corner. It's dark there and quite well hidden. Then I back my car into the spot, put it into neutral, and push it gently until it rests against the wall. So the wall completely blocks my rear plate. And I have no front plate. So the parking attendant, if they happen to walk all the way into that corner, cannot easily read my plate.

I see many of my coworkers complaining about the prices, or showing parking tickets they got because they forgot to pay that day. But so far I have not gotten a ticket.

all,AITAH for not selling my neighbor a thrifted rocking chair I JUST BOUGHT?,"I honestly have no words.  I (27)  just bought my house in july 2024.  We have learned that most of the neighbors are all old as hell.( i think these neighbors are 60s +) and are very nosey and onery that young families are moving into the neighborhood in recent years. They will just walk up to you and tell you this. 

I have been shopping thrift and estate sales to furnish this cute house. This morning, I came home from an estate sale with a BEAUTIFUL wingbacked rocking chair. (It needs to be reuplostered as the leather that was on it is in terrible condition and the previous owner started pulling it off. ) 

Im unloading it from the bed of my truck when neighbor , Carol,  sticks her giraffe neck over the fence and starts squawking about how beautiful it is . I said thanks i got it at an estate sale for $10! This triggered the parasites in her brain and she, i shit you not, teleported over to the truck. She starts going off about how much she needs a chair to rock her grandkids to sleep in and how much she would appreciate it if it was hers. I told her I got it for my future babies to be rocked to sleep in and that it still  needs lots of work before it can be used. Mind you this chair is large and she is very small. 

This is when she starts offering me money ($15 because "" its more than what you paid for it"") then telling me i dont need it because i dont have kids yet and her grandkids are only little for so long. After firmly telling her i wasn't interested in selling it, she offered me $20.

popular,"AITA for divorcing my wife and not wanting to give her half after she said I ""wasted her time""?","I (32M) have been married to my wife (28F) for six years. We met when she was 21, I was 25. We dated for about a year before getting married. Things were good for a long time, but in the past two years, I started realizing we‚Äôd grown into very different people. We want different things, have different priorities, and to be completely honest  the love I felt for her has slowly faded. I didn't cheat, I didn't lie  I just fell out of love.

I tried to communicate. We did therapy. I gave it time. But eventually, I came to the conclusion that staying married would just be delaying the inevitable, and it wouldn‚Äôt be fair to either of us. So I told her I wanted a divorce.

She was understandably upset, but then things escalated. She said I ""wasted her time"" and that I ""used up her good years"" only to leave her. She now wants half of everything  the house, my retirement account, investments  even though she didn‚Äôt contribute much financially (she‚Äôs been in and out of work, and I‚Äôve been the primary earner for most of the marriage).

We signed a prenuptial agreement before we got married. It was fair she had her own lawyer, there was no pressure, and it clearly laid out what would happen if we ever split. It protects the assets I brought into the marriage, and it doesn‚Äôt entitle either of us to spousal support unless certain conditions are met (which aren‚Äôt).

Now she‚Äôs saying the prenup shouldn't matter, because I ""emotionally conned"" her into a dead-end marriage and wasted her youth. That even though it‚Äôs legally binding, morally I should give her half because I ‚Äútook her best years and gave nothing back.‚Äù

I don‚Äôt see it that way. I loved her when we married. I was faithful. I supported her emotionally and financially. I tried everything to make it work. Falling out of love isn‚Äôt a crime and I don‚Äôt think I should be punished for something I didn‚Äôt do maliciously.

popular,Coworker found me on a dating app and won't let it go. What do I do?,"I am a female that works in a primarily male dominated field. I truly love my job, it's probably the best one I've had by far. Here's the coworker issue: one of my coworkers found me on a dating app. Well, he said his brother found me and asked him if he worked with me, due to my specification of the industry I worked in/my location. I wasn't working the day he made this discovery. Upon finding out I was on said dating app, he made it a point to let EVERYONE know I was. I found it odd. Why should he or anyone else care? I then realized it was in a ""damn she's desperate"" fashion. Not only is the workplace and field in general male dominated, but I am more than 20 years younger than the majority of my coworkers- with the exception of the guy who spread the info and a couple others. 

I didn't care initially, I presumed it would blow over; but it indeed has not. He and a few others bring it up in a mocking or teasing way quite regularly. It really wasn't funny the first time, and it definitely wasn't the second, third, or fourth time. I want to highlight that the intention does not feel playful, but instead is delivered in a very demeaning way. I will occasionally get unsolicited advice on my appearance from the same coworker.

I'm looking for advice on what I can do in this situation without turning it into an HR fiasco. I only plan to stay at this job until mid 2026. I want to make my next year enjoyable. What should I say next time he or another coworker brings it up? Something that will really embarrass them perhaps?

popular,I've been stealing parking from my work every day for months,"My work charges $10/day for parking in the parking garage, which really adds up. We are supposed to pay this out of our own pockets. But I don't pay.

I found a parking spot on the bottom floor of the garage that is all the way in the corner. It's dark there and quite well hidden. Then I back my car into the spot, put it into neutral, and push it gently until it rests against the wall. So the wall completely blocks my rear plate. And I have no front plate. So the parking attendant, if they happen to walk all the way into that corner, cannot easily read my plate.

I see many of my coworkers complaining about the prices, or showing parking tickets they got because they forgot to pay that day. But so far I have not gotten a ticket. 

Eventually I will get a ticket I think, and at that point I will not pay it and just start taking public transportation to work",3277.0,283.0,2025-05-04 01:33:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1ke8hgy/ive_been_stealing_parking_from_my_work_every_day/,'ve steal park work every day month,11,60,5.454545454545454,0.0,0.0,work charge 10 day park park garage really add suppose pay pocket n't pay find park spot bottom floor garage way corner 's dark quite well hide back car spot put neutral push gently rest wall wall completely block rear plate no front plate park attendant happen walk way corner not easily read plate see many coworkers complain price show park ticket get forget pay day far not get ticket eventually get ticket think point not pay start take public transportation work,169,868,5.136094674556213,0.16805555555555554,0.4944444444444444,0.016131357630938415
all,AITAH for not selling my neighbor a thrifted rocking chair I JUST BOUGHT?,"I honestly have no words.  I (27)  just bought my house in july 2024.  We have learned that most of the neighbors are all old as hell.( i think these neighbors are 60s +) and are very nosey and onery that young families are moving into the neighborhood in recent years. They will just walk up to you and tell you this. 

I have been shopping thrift and estate sales to furnish this cute house. This morning, I came home from an estate sale with a BEAUTIFUL wingbacked rocking chair. (It needs to be reuplostered as the leather that was on it is in terrible condition and the previous owner started pulling it off. ) 

Im unloading it from the bed of my truck when neighbor , Carol,  sticks her giraffe neck over the fence and starts squawking about how beautiful it is . I said thanks i got it at an estate sale for $10! This triggered the parasites in her brain and she, i shit you not, teleported over to the truck. She starts going off about how much she needs a chair to rock her grandkids to sleep in and how much she would appreciate it if it was hers. I told her I got it for my future babies to be rocked to sleep in and that it still  needs lots of work before it can be used. Mind you this chair is large and she is very small. 

This is when she starts offering me money ($15 because "" its more than what you paid for it"") then telling me i dont need it because i dont have kids yet and her grandkids are only little for so long. After firmly telling her i wasn't interested in selling it, she offered me $20. 

I was standing in the bed of the truck looking down at her on the driveway and firmly said ""No, Carol im really not interested in selling this. Please go home."" And pointed to her side of the fence. Apparently this was shouting at her and being aggressive.  

She ran home and later in the day her husband said something to my husband as he was getting home from a game.  Telling him i (edit:"" spoke to her like a dog"" ) and was being  a ""nasty neighbor"" and that my husband needs to ""straighten me out.""  

Are my neighbors nuts? Was I that rude to her? 

(Edit I tried to attach a photo of the chair but i cant attach it on this community)

Edit : I meant no offense when I said "" old as hell"". I know that 60 is only half way through a life time.   I was trying to paint a caricature of who Carol and our other neighbors are.

popular,America having real predators makes it scarier then Australia,"As an Australian I always hear people go on and on about how dangerous Australia is. 

But if you're not stupid you're fine 

Snakes: pretty fucking avoidable if you go into the bush wear thick clothes and boots ans stomp around and we have the best snake health care in the world 

Spiders: no one's died from a spider bite since the 70s , (doesn't America get a few spider bite related deaths a year?) 

Sharks: don't swim in water where there's sharks? Swim around life guards swim close to the coast. It's very avoidable, especially if you're a tourist 

Crocodile; in very specific area that just don't go into. Also America has Alligators so

And then we literally do not have any other dangerous animal  that could cause you harm

Dingos: don't go into the desert. And why are you in the desert alone as a tourist.  That's just dumb, also they're not that big at all

Fyi if anyone brings up kangaroos. I'm telling you almost all kangaroo attacks you see online are their own fault. Kangaroos are very skittish animals. So if you managed to piss off a kangaroo I'm 100% blaming you


What does America have. bears! bears could maul you, what's a snake gonna do have a painful bite and vomit. Bears could eat off all your limbs and leave you bleeding to death

Wolves: fucking dangerous mfers who again can maul you to death

Coyotes: also the same

America has real actual massive teeth animals that could kill you. 

Also mountain lions- again  an actual real predator!

In Australia: literallydont be stupid. If you're not dumb and stay away from.places where animals live. You will be 100% fine.

popular,TIFU by ordering a DNA test as a fun gift for my family and ended up destroying 40 years of family history,"I was scrolling on tiktok and I saw one where some guy bought some ancestry kits to use with his family. It looked fun and a completely different thing compared to the usual gifts and recently I got a tax return so I figured I'd buy some for my family members as a small little gift. I'm very into genealogy and figured we'd learn some cool stuff about our heritage. Fun fact before we continue: my mom's always been proud of her Irish roots from her dad's side.

We ran them up and the results came back: My mom has 0% Irish DNA.  Turns out her ""dad"" wasn't her biological father. I almost fainted. I literally just couldn't believe it. When we asked my 89-year-old grandmother (who has dementia), she admitted to having an affair. She never told anyone for 65 years. I swear I thought this stuff only happens in movies cuz how tf did I end up experiencing this with my own family?!  
My mom hasn't spoken to me in three weeks. She says I destroyed her identity. 

3 weeks later and I still don't know why the fuck did I end up doing this. I wish I could go back in time and never do it

popular,AITA for cooking with cooking wine when I am a recovering alcoholic?,"I am a recovering alcoholic and I have been sober for 4 years. One thing that came out of sobriety was my love for cooking. In the beginning, it kept me busy and I didn‚Äôt want to drink if I was not hungry. Now, I just love the process of making a delicious meal for myself and loved ones. 

Recently I had my family over for a meal. One of the components of the meal was chicken Marsala. I love chicken Marsala. I make and eat it all the time. One of the ingredients is cooking Marsala wine. 

I brought out the meal and my sister asked what the chicken was. I said it was chicken Marsala. She asked if I used wine. I said I use cooking wine, not regular wine. 

This started an argument about me using and owning cooking wine as an alcoholic. My sister said that I am relapsing by cooking with it and they I have basically been lying to them about being sober. 

I argued back that you don‚Äôt get drunk from eating food with cooking wine. You are ingesting some alcohol, but the whole recipe had 2/3 of a cup of wine, my portion has even less. I make this because it‚Äôs delicious, not because it gets me buzzed. It also does not trigger any cravings for me to drink.

all,America having real predators makes it scarier then Australia,"As an Australian I always hear people go on and on about how dangerous Australia is. 

But if you're not stupid you're fine 

Snakes: pretty fucking avoidable if you go into the bush wear thick clothes and boots ans stomp around and we have the best snake health care in the world 

Spiders: no one's died from a spider bite since the 70s , (doesn't America get a few spider bite related deaths a year?) 

Sharks: don't swim in water where there's sharks? Swim around life guards swim close to the coast. It's very avoidable, especially if you're a tourist 

Crocodile; in very specific area that just don't go into. Also America has Alligators so

And then we literally do not have any other dangerous animal  that could cause you harm

Dingos: don't go into the desert. And why are you in the desert alone as a tourist.  That's just dumb, also they're not that big at all

Fyi if anyone brings up kangaroos. I'm telling you almost all kangaroo attacks you see online are their own fault. Kangaroos are very skittish animals. So if you managed to piss off a kangaroo I'm 100% blaming you


What does America have. bears! bears could maul you, what's a snake gonna do have a painful bite and vomit. Bears could eat off all your limbs and leave you bleeding to death

Wolves: fucking dangerous mfers who again can maul you to death

Coyotes: also the same

America has real actual massive teeth animals that could kill you. 

Also mountain lions- again  an actual real predator!

In Australia: literallydont be stupid. If you're not dumb and stay away from.places where animals live. You will be 100% fine.

She‚Äôs made some great cakes in the past, and I wanted to support her, so I asked if she could make a cake for my mom‚Äôs 60th birthday. I told her I wanted something floral and elegant, and I gave her some examples. I also told her clearly that my mom is allergic to almonds like, epi-pen level allergic.

She agreed, and I paid her a $100 deposit for the $250 cake. A week later, I went to pick it up and she was so proud of it. It looked beautiful, honestly, but when I asked what flavor it was, she told me it was almond vanilla, because she thought it gave it a ‚Äúmore upscale taste.‚Äù

I was shocked. I reminded her my mom is allergic to almonds, and she just kind of brushed it off and said it was such a small amount and it would be fine as long as my mom didn‚Äôt eat too much. I told her I couldn‚Äôt take the cake, and she got upset, saying I was being overdramatic and ungrateful for all her hard work.

I told her she could either make a new cake or I wouldn‚Äôt be paying the rest. She refused, and now mutual friends are telling me I should‚Äôve just accepted it and gotten a different dessert for my mom. Others say I was right not to risk it.

What confuses me about all of this is the sheer stupidity of it all. He worked with the CIA, he's not dumb.

He *HAD* to have known that if this thing was fake, it was going to be found. So I am left thinking that this is intentional, I guess. Because if he knew it was fake, then he had to have known it would be debunked, and that it would damage the disclosure effort. Which sucks! I like Lue. But this is just silly.

popular,Am I the only one who thinks the Trump ‚Äúear shot‚Äù was a staged political stunt to humanize him before the election?,"Okay, bear with me. I know this sounds like conspiracy territory ‚Äî but the more I think about it, the more it *doesn't* sit right.

Let‚Äôs look at the facts:

* **The timing?** Impeccable. Right when his campaign was floundering in terms of public sympathy and momentum, he suddenly becomes a ‚Äúsurvivor‚Äù of a *failed assassination attempt*. Cue media frenzy, rally cries, and instant victim-turned-hero energy.
* **The injury?** His *ear*. Not lethal. Not life-threatening. But *just enough* to be dramatic. It leaves a visible mark without disabling him ‚Äî the perfect setup for a comeback photo op.
* **The effect?** People who previously saw him as reckless or power-hungry are suddenly seeing a ‚Äúhuman‚Äù side. A wounded man, supposedly targeted just for telling the truth. It reframes him as the underdog ‚Äî even a martyr ‚Äî and historically, those narratives win elections.
* **The rollout?** Way too polished. Speeches, videos, statements ‚Äî all ready to go like it was part of a campaign strategy. There wasn‚Äôt panic, there was *production*.

This feels like a play right out of the authoritarian PR handbook: **create chaos, survive it publicly, and watch your approval ratings climb.** We've seen this tactic before ‚Äî it's manipulative, emotional propaganda masked as ‚Äúpatriotism.‚Äù

I'm not saying it *definitely* was staged ‚Äî but I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs a hell of a lot more convenient than it is convincing.

Curious if anyone else had this gut reaction, or if I‚Äôm alone on this hill.

Posts like this should absolutely be flagged and investigated by federal authorities. Under Title 18 U.S. Code ¬ß‚ÄØ871, threatening the President is a federal crime, and anyone crossing that line should face prosecution. This isn‚Äôt protected speech‚Äîit‚Äôs a direct threat to national leadership.

If found guilty, they should face the full weight of the law. While treason, as defined in the Constitution, is a specific and narrow charge, actions that promote violence against the government can lead to serious consequences, including imprisonment.

Calls for harm aren‚Äôt ‚Äúopinions‚Äù‚Äîthey‚Äôre criminal acts, and it‚Äôs time we stop tolerating them under the guise of free speech. AI should be used to track these cowards down, identify them, and bring them to justice. If they hate this country so much, maybe El Salvador or GITMO is exactly where they belong.

popular,AITAH for kicking out my gf's sister and her kids out of my flat after my gf gave her the keys,"People around me are saying I am an AH but I need the perspective of uninvolved people.  
My long term gf has my apartment keys, as I have hers. Only unspoken until now but always respected rule was, if you need to go to the other place, just send a text ""Hey going to your place"". Doesn't matter if the other is at home or even responds. Just simply to tell the other you will be at their place.  
  
I was supposed to be away 700km from home for 2 weeks for work related stuff, but 4 days in and our instructor got into an accident. Work tried to find another one, but no such luck on very short notice. They decided at like 10pm to get us the 1st flight home the next day at like 6am, pay us the overtime and the next day at home, then resume our normal work schedule.  
So I get home the next day at like 9am, sent a text to my gf to tell her I am back.  
Getting to my door, I am very confused hearing children screaming inside since none of the people who have my keys have low kids like that (my brother and my gf). I thought I got squatters or something. Opening the door and I see my gf's sister's kid running around after a shower, putting water everywhere. Plates of half finished ravioli on my living room ground. Their suitcases opened in the entrance.  
  
I get inside and see the husband on my couch trying to hook up my PS2(that he must have digged out in my storage room). Getting into a verbal argument with him trying to understand why the fuck they are here. Said my gf told them they could get my flat for 2 weeks while I was gone (they wanted to visit the city for a bit, go to the beach). My gf sent me a text while i was arguing, telling me ""oh ok, btw my sis fam' is at your flat"".  
  
I admit I blew up on him and the sis who left my bedroom in the meantime. Told them to leave immediately. They argued quite a bit, my gf called her sis, then sis put up the speaker so we could all hear, and she said I was embarrassing her, that she told them they could use my place for a while.  
  
I threatened to call the police, also asked my brothers to come.  
They left while cursing me to their children, telling that holidays are over because the mean little sister's boyfriend cast us out.  
I have now all of my gf family on my back, and even some of my own family, saying i could have stayed with at my gf so the kids could have some vacations...  
  
Also. They have read my doctor prescription papers(I put them in a specific order, and it was not the same), and obviously took some of my prescribed meds (opened a box of benzodiazepine...).  
  
AITAH for making them leave?
We pretty much stopped talking about anything else with my gf. I feel like i am being gaslighted. I would never invite people to her apartment like that, especially without telling her. It seems so disrespectful.

popular,AITA for not caring that my husband sleeps with other women even though we‚Äôre married?,"I (26F) have been married to my husband (38M) for four years. We have two young kids together (M2) and a (F10 months) When we got together, he was very upfront with me about the fact that he doesn‚Äôt believe in strict monogamy. He‚Äôs always been honest that he sometimes wants to sleep with other women, and I agreed to it under the condition that he‚Äôd always be open and respectful about it  no lying, no sneaking around.

It‚Äôs not for everyone, I get that. But for us, it works. I‚Äôm not the jealous type, and emotionally, we‚Äôre very connected. He‚Äôs a great dad, really involved, and we live comfortably. He owns a few businesses and does very well financially  We live in a nice big house in a gated neighborhood,and ate able to travel whenever we want and I‚Äôve been able to stay home with the kids without worrying about money.

The issue started last week when my cousin saw him out at a bar with another woman. She apparently recognized him, took a photo, and sent it to my sister. My sister immediately called me in a panic, saying ‚Äúhe‚Äôs cheating on you,‚Äù and when I told her that I already knew and that it‚Äôs not a secret, she completely flipped.

She said I was ‚Äúletting myself be disrespected‚Äù and ‚Äúhurting my kids‚Äù by staying in a marriage like this. She went off about how I‚Äôm setting a horrible example and even said, ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt tell Mom and Dad, I will.‚Äù

I tried to explain that it‚Äôs something we agreed on and that our kids are safe, loved, and have both parents present. But she‚Äôs acting like I‚Äôm being brainwashed or manipulated. I honestly don‚Äôt see the issue. This is our agreement, and it doesn‚Äôt affect how we raise our children or how we function as a family.

Now I‚Äôm stuck with this anxiety about my family finding out and judging me, even though I‚Äôm genuinely okay with the arrangement. I feel like they‚Äôre projecting their values onto my marriage and not even trying to understand that different relationships can work in different ways.

popular,PSA: It is highly likely PS5 consoles and games are about to be more expensive. Make sure your prepared,"If you didn't see the news, Xbox pricing is increasing across the board. Expect Sony to follow soon as well. If you're looking to get a PS5 I would do so sooner rather than later. Same with any games you've been eyeing. You can always wait for sales of course, but it's hard to see what will happen in the future. 

Just thought I would post a friendly reminder and heads up.

**Edit:  I am aware that in other countries the cost of the PS5 has gone up in the last few weeks, but I would expect another massive increase as well. Multiple video games market analysts are saying this is just the beginning. ""Market conditions"" are tarrifs. So be prepared.**

popular,I (34m) house sit for other people with the specific goal of going through their things.,"So I‚Äôve been a house sitter/dog watcher for a number of years. It‚Äôs truly easy money. I‚Äôm excellent at what I do. Odds are your place will be cleaner than when you left for your vacation or work trip. I‚Äôll collect your mail and organize it by the date it was delivered, wash all my towels and bed sheets, never have guest over, etc, etc. However unknown to you and every person who has let me house sit. I‚Äôm going to go through your things. Specifically your clothes. Mainly just your clothes. I‚Äôll open and go through every closet, and open and go through all your drawers. Dresses, suits, bathing suits, sweaters, pants, skirts, underwear, scarves, jackets, hosiery, hats, you own it, I‚Äôm going to take a look. If I really like something, if it really catches my eye or gets my heart going, I‚Äôll try it on. I‚Äôll stand in front of your mirror and see how it fits me. I‚Äôll wear it around the house and see how it feels. Especially if you‚Äôre married woman, for some reason your things in particular I love to look through and wear.

Yes the thrill is doing something I‚Äôm not supposed to be doing and the thrill of possibly getting caught in your sexiest outfit. But mainly, if you thought it was nice enough to buy and wear, I want to see why. When I‚Äôm done, I‚Äôll fold it back up, or hang it exactly how I found it. You never know. How do I know, because you‚Äôve asked me to house sit again and again and again.

It started when I was back in high school. My friends would have a party, and when everyone was outside, I‚Äôd go upstairs and see what their mom had tucked away, then I‚Äôd try it on see how I looked, the fold it back and put it away like nothing ever happened. Then I started house sitting, and found out I could have free reign and not have to sneak around.

I‚Äôm sure this all sounds incredibly creepy, and like a breach of trust, I‚Äôm not looking for advice, just wanted to get it off my chest.

popular,AITAH for telling my husband I‚Äôd rather raise a kid who stands up for themselves than one who blindly obeys?,"I‚Äôm 32F, my husband is 31M. We have a 6yrs old son, Leo. He‚Äôs a sweet, curious kid who‚Äôs really into dinosaurs and loves riding his little blue bike.

Last weekend, I went grocery shopping while my husband stayed home with Leo. Apparently, Leo was outside riding his bike and left it in the front yard while he went inside to get water. A few minutes later, our neighbor, Ms. Robert, came over saying her grandson (8M) saw Leo take his bike. My husband looked out, didn‚Äôt see Leo‚Äôs bike, and assumed the worst.

He confronted Leo, who insisted he didn‚Äôt steal anything. He said his bike was gone. My husband didn‚Äôt believe him and told him he was grounded, no TV, no tablet until he told the truth and apologized.

Leo refused, saying, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt take anyone‚Äôs bike! Why are you punishing me when I didn‚Äôt do anything?‚Äù

Later that afternoon, Ms. Robert returned, visibly embarrassed. Turns out her grandson had taken Leo‚Äôs bike to the park because he thought it looked cooler. He made the whole story up to avoid getting in trouble.

When I got home, my husband explained the situation. I figured, ‚ÄúOkay, you‚Äôll apologize to Leo and this will be a learning moment.‚Äù But nope he doubled down. He said Leo still needed to be punished for ‚Äúdisrespect‚Äù and ‚Äúrefusing to obey.‚Äù

I said, ‚ÄúSo you want to punish him for telling the truth and standing up for himself?‚Äù

He said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the principle. He needs to listen, even when he doesn‚Äôt agree.‚Äù

And I said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather raise a boy who knows how to stand up for himself than one who just lays down and accepts mistreatment. Especially when he‚Äôs innocent.‚Äù

We got into a pretty heated argument. He says I‚Äôm being unreasonable and dramatic and undermining him as a parent.

But I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm wrong for wanting to teach my son that it‚Äôs okay to say no when something is unfair, even if it‚Äôs coming from a parent.

all,Some upper management walked in on a random goodbye party and now it‚Äôs really tense‚Ä¶,"I don‚Äôt even know how to write this correctly, but it‚Äôs laughable how management thinks.

Work in biotech as a service provider associated with a big company that outsources everything. Though this is particular to my company, not the big boys we provide service to.

Anyways, a member of the facilities team was leaving, so we had a brief little pizza party/cake on our lunch break on Friday. A bigger boss, about 2 steps above my direct manager, pops in randomly and asks what‚Äôs going on. Turns out the facilities member leaving wasn‚Äôt something he was aware of, etc. Their team is already gutted and only has 2 of the normal 5 man team they need. People leaving, etc.

The leaving team member had not alerted our company to him leaving (he was quitting that day) and most of us found out that in that moment. Today, Monday, boss pops in and says we all are in big trouble because we all had a party on Friday and didn‚Äôt let management know. That it could be seen as time fraud, etc. That they may restructure our office area in response and possibly a window on the office door.

I just find it really odd that this entire response occurred when it should be more of a time for introspection or investigation as to the why.

My name is Denzo, and I write this letter with a heart weighed down by despair and desperation. I find myself in a place I never imagined‚Äîa place where I feel completely alone, broken, and overwhelmed by life‚Äôs burdens.

Every day has become a struggle to survive. I owe money to someone, and that debt is like a dark shadow that follows me everywhere. I haven‚Äôt had a decent meal in days, and the gnawing hunger only adds to the constant ache inside me. I trusted those I called friends, only to be left behind when I needed them the most. Now, with no one to turn to, the loneliness and hopelessness have pushed me to the brink. I‚Äôve even started to wonder if ending it all might be the only escape from this crushing pain.

I know this may sound desperate, but I‚Äôm reaching out with a plea for help. I need just some money to pull myself back from the edge‚Äîa small amount that could be the first step toward getting food, safety, and a chance to seek the help I desperately need. This isn‚Äôt just about money; it‚Äôs about having a lifeline when everything seems lost.

If you can find it in your heart to help, no matter how small the contribution, you would be giving me a reason to believe that there is still hope in this dark world. Your kindness could be the spark that reignites my will to live and helps me find a way to rebuild my shattered life.

Thank you for taking the time to read my plea. I hold onto the hope that someone out there understands my pain and will offer the hand I so desperately need.

With all the hope I have left,

Porcupine Tree is unquestionably one of the most difficult-to-categorize and innovative rock bands of all time. The band was formed by musician Steven Wilson in 1987, and began essentially as a solo project for Wilson, who created all of the music. By December 1993, Wilson desired to work in a band environment, and so brought on frequent collaborators. The band has been on hiatus since 2010.

The voice of the promise of the '60s counter-culture. The guy who forced folk into bed with rock. Who donned make-up in the '70s and disappeared into a haze of substance abuse. Who emerged to find Jesus. Who was written off as a has-been by the end of the '80s and who suddenly shifted gears, releasing some of the strongest music of his career beginning in the late '90s.

Ladies and gentlemen ‚Äî Columbia recording artist Bob Dylan!

Welcome to the subreddit of the poet laureate of rock 'n' roll.

The voice of the promise of the '60s counter-culture. The guy who forced folk into bed with rock. Who donned make-up in the '70s and disappeared into a haze of substance abuse. Who emerged to find Jesus. Who was written off as a has-been by the end of the '80s and who suddenly shifted gears, releasing some of the strongest music of his career beginning in the late '90s.

You know in games or movies when you find a odd little secret that someone in production left unnoticed for the few in the audience that would look for it or happen to stumble upon it?  This is the place to share those things you find in real life. 

This isn‚Äôt the area for posting digital Easter eggs, as in screenshots or photographs of screens (games, computer software, TV series, DVD menus); as those are regular Easter eggs and not IRL Easter eggs. Try /r/EasterEggs for such things.

popular,AITA for turning my sister away for the second time after she slept with the father of my children while I was with him and then came to me when he cheated and passed on STDs/STIs to her?,"I (27f) have three children with my now ex Kon (29m). 10 months ago my sister (26f) confessed that she and Kon had slept together the week before and she said she regretted it and needed us to be okay. She told me it was a mistake and she got caught up in a moment because she had a crush on Kon and she needed me not to hate her for it. That she loved me and wanted us to make things work. Kon didn't even try to deny it. He told me he'd been sleeping around for years and that he slept with my sister more than once. My sister denied it strongly. I broke up with him immediately and told her to get lost. I said I never wanted to see her again and that she disgusted and repulsed me and I didn't care how bad she felt, I wanted her to feel bad, I wanted her to hurt and she would never hurt as much as I was right then so forget about me.

I got checked after I broke up with Kon to make sure he didn't give me anything with all the cheating. I was negative for all STDs and I'm incredibly thankful for that. With the amount of cheating he talked about I'm still surprised I didn't catch anything.

She ended up dating Kon because I rejected her. Or that was the story she told others. She said she felt guilty and needed some good to come from this because clearly I would never give her the time of day again. And that's true. I swore to myself that I would not forgive her. Even through therapy I have become more secure in the belief that what she did broke our relationship beyond repair and regardless of whether it was one time (which I don't believe) or a full affair it was wrong and we'll never come back from it. I really don't care what happens to her and if she died tomorrow I would not grieve or make an appearance at her funeral. 

Recently my sister found out Kon had cheated on her and he didn't only cheat but he passed along some STDs/STIs. I don't know specifics. I believe she's also waiting to make sure he didn't give her HIV. Although I can't say I paid enough attention to know if that was a big concern or just them being cautious. But she thought that experience would make me more forgiving of her. She was wrong. She showed up at my place and I shut the door in her face without saying a word. She showed up at our brothers house while I was heading inside and he shooed her but she told me how sorry she was again and how scared she was and how much she needed me. I ignored her and kept going and our brother told her she wasn't welcome.

She tried again and this time I did respond. I told her I do not care and if anything she deserves everything she got after what she did and how stupid she was in the end. She told me she needed me and that she was scared. I told her just like when I found out my partner of 8 years and father of my children was cheating and I could have used my sister only she betrayed me as well by cheating with him. She said it was one time and she would have been there for me and I told her I didn't want her disgusting self to touch me. Because I said that's how I saw her now a disgusting backstabber. I told her I don't care if he's given her every STD under the sun, because I want nothing more to do with her and she can die in a hole for all I care.

I haven't seen her since. Apparently she's very distraught and she's also the topic of gossip in our social circles. She lost most of our shared friends and a few have shared a similar sentiment to me on her. But a couple have asked me if I don't even feel a little bad for being so cruel to her and turning her away a second time even after all her apologies. They said they felt like I should have found a way to work through this because we were close for such a long time and sisters are for life or whatever stupid crap they said.

I don't feel guilty. I don't even feel bad for her or have any kind of empathy.

all,Fuck All Ya'll,"2025 has sucked. I have been full of barely contained rage since November, but today's press conference where the current administration laughed while refusing a SCOTUS order and talking about sending anyone they deemed a ""violent criminal"" to CECOT was my breaking point.

My fucks to give are gone. I did not spend more than two decades fighting terrorists and despots to watch the country turn into a terrorist nation run by a despot. 

So, all that said:

Trump, fuck you. 

Vance, fuck you. 

Mike Johnson, fuck you. 

Stephen Miller, fuck you too. 

Elon Musk, fuck you. 

Vought, Thiel, and The Heritage Foundation; fuck all ya'll.

Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, fuck you. Roberts, Kavanaugh, and Coney-Barret, I challenge you to do the right thing and fix the fuck ups you have had. 

Rubio, Hegseth, and the entire Trump administration, fuck you. 

Anyone who wears a fucking Trump lapel pin or supports MAGA, fuck you too. 

If you're not into actual civil liberties and ""justice for all,"" fuck all ya'll.

It is time for the Judicial and Legislative branches to do their jobs and REMOVE Trump. It is time for the Republican party to take back their party and REPLACE the MAGA parasites. 

It is time for the Democratic party to stop being complicit, find their courage, and REPAIR our broken nation.

Do not sit down. Do not remain silent. Say fuck you to that fat, orange fuck ruining the country and RECLAIM the term ""FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT!""

Do everything you can to effect positive change. 

Fuck 'em.

EDIT 1: Thanks to the folks who've pointed out my incorrect names of a couple of SCOTUS folks. I was fat-fingering that in the passenger seat of a moving car while suppressing my rage. 

EDIT 2: By popular demand, I added Stephen Miller.

all,I held on too long and all it did was hurt my daughter,"My daughter had multiple congenital birth defects that led to a lifetime of complications. With medically complex kids you fix one problem and create two more.

 She lived 11 years. It was probably 9 years too long. She lived most of her life in hospitals. Literally months at a time. She would sometimes be home a week or two and then end up back in. I don't think she ever spent more than two consecutive months out of the hospital in her entire life, until she went on palliative care. 

She was more comfortable in the hospital than anywhere else. How sad is that. She was the ""warrior"" kid. That was her whole identity. Making cards for her nurses and decorating her medical equipment and being Tough with a capital T. That was all she had. Never went to school, not in any meaningful capacity. Never played a sport or an instrument. Never had any real friends to speak of. Never had the health to take up any real hobbies. Just an entire life made up of surgeries, shots and nurses and fucking medical equipment to decorate. I gave her a pathetic life. 

There wasn't a single intervention I wasn't willing to put her through to buy more time. She was the happiest, most accepting kid I've ever met but in the last six months she was done. I refused to listen. She asked me over and over again if she could just ""stop"". I would push until she shut up and went along with what I wanted. Why did I do that.

all,AITA - told mom she can bill me using the tuition money she stole from me,"When I (m33) was preparing to go to uni, my mom confessed that there was no tuition money for me. Through the years my dad would give her cash to deposit but she only did the first one. She spent the rest. TBH I wasn't even surprised. I was used to being disappointed by her. She promised that she would ""pay me back"" and asked that I never tell me dad. So for four years I thanked them for the tuition money while I took out loans.

For reasons to do with her narcissism, I have an arms length relationship with her, but she would say we're pretty close as she assumes my smiling and nodding while she drones on about the same stories is a relationship.

We have a family cottage that she puts above everything else. She lives there about 90 days of the year. I've been going there with my gf for about 4 days for a couple summers which she begrudges as it takes away from her time. My dad supports my going which is how I pull it off. 

She recently told me that it was time for me to start paying for some of the maintenance on the cottage since I use it. She actually suggested 1k which is wildly disproportionate. I told her she could take it out of the tuition IOU and we could negotiate the amount with dad.

She was speechless. She texted me later to say that it manipulative to bring up the tuition and to threaten to tell dad. It went on and on. 

I've been thinking about it and First, I'm hurt/offended that she can't just do a nice thing for me, she has to get something for it. 
Second, I guess I'm not really over the whole tuition thing. 

WITAH for bringing up ancient history and not paying her for use of the cottage?

popular,"AITA for asking my husband not to go on a trip with a woman who openly flirts with him, and feeling betrayed when he did anyway?","Hi everyone,
I‚Äôm a 32F and I‚Äôve been married to my husband (let's call him Joe) for 8 years, together for 10. In all that time, we‚Äôve always prioritized each other‚Äôs emotional well-being. If something hurt one of us, we didn‚Äôt do it again ‚Äî no matter what. We valued having a happy spouse more than being ‚Äúright.‚Äù Because of this, my love and trust for him grew immensely. I was certain he‚Äôd never do anything that would break my heart.

But here I am, heartbroken and disappointed.

Joe owns a company, and we work together. Financially, we‚Äôre in a great place. Recently, through Joe‚Äôs father, we got the chance to bid for a major government contract ‚Äî a massive opportunity. Due to its scale, several companies are teaming up, and one key company involved (without whom the deal won‚Äôt happen) is led by a very attractive, flirty woman. She‚Äôs the CEO and has openly flirted with Joe in front of me.

We both noticed her behavior, and in order to avoid misunderstandings or conflict, we decided to work on the bid together. Things were okay until one meeting where, during a break, she touched Joe‚Äôs arm and said something like, ‚ÄúIf I had a husband like you, I‚Äôd never leave his side. You‚Äôre someone every woman wants, but sometimes even that‚Äôs not enough ‚Äî someone else might steal your mind.‚Äù

I snapped and responded, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not following him ‚Äî he just never leaves my side.‚Äù
She brushed it off as a joke, but I know it wasn‚Äôt. I saw the look in her eyes ‚Äî and women just know.

Later, I talked to Joe about it. He admitted she was crossing a line and that he was uncomfortable, but didn‚Äôt react strongly to avoid jeopardizing the deal. I wasn‚Äôt thrilled, but I tried to understand.

Then today, I found out that I was excluded from a 3-day site visit for the bid ‚Äî a trip requested by that woman. Only five people are going, and Joe is one of them. When I heard, I told him I was extremely uncomfortable with this, and asked him not to go. I begged, actually. I said the deal wasn‚Äôt worth this. We‚Äôre financially stable and don‚Äôt need this contract.

But he went anyway.
Even after everything I said, he left without me.

Something broke in me. I trusted him with my whole heart. I truly believed he‚Äôd never choose anything over my peace of mind. Now I feel like he did. He left me behind. And it hurts so deeply that part of me doesn‚Äôt even care anymore ‚Äî if he comes back, if he ends up with that woman ‚Äî I feel numb.

A part of me says, ‚ÄúCome on, 10 amazing years ‚Äî don‚Äôt throw it all away.‚Äù
Another part wants to take off my wedding ring, send him a photo, and file for divorce.

So... AITA for asking him not to go?

popular,When did you realize Elon Musk is a fraud?,"Do you recall where and when you realized Elon Musk's entire life, qualifications, career, and ""engineering knowledge"" are all a total fabrication? (Pre approved by mods)


I was on break at work in mid-2014 when I read a newspaper article in which he was pimping his latest snake oil and vaporware. He said something that my boss at the time would say from time to time.

My boss was a liar and a crook, took credit for every success, and placed blame on every failure that happened anywhere near him.

He's a textbook example of a narcissistic sociopath.

It clicked in my brain, and I realized Musk, like my boss, has never created a single thing. He comes up with an idea and tells people to get to work on it, assigning a due date that has absolutely no basis in reality, similar to ""It's March 20th. You can all cobble this together in a month. We'll release it on 4-20!!! It's going to be awesome because it's like a joke, it's funny!!!""

He makes promises that others have to fulfill, taking credit for the work everyone else had to do to develop the technology that didn't exist until the real engineers invented it.

My distaste took a year to morph into a loathing of everything that he stands for.

>Navarro isn‚Äôt one to back down during policy debates and had stridently urged Trump to keep tariffs in place, even as corporate chieftains and other advisers urged him to relent. And Navarro had been regularly around the Oval Office since Trump‚Äôs ‚ÄúLiberation Day‚Äù event. 
>So that morning, when Navarro was scheduled to meet with economic adviser Kevin Hassett in a different part of the White House, Bessent and Lutnick made their move, according to multiple people familiar with the intervention.
>
>They rushed to the Oval Office to see Trump and propose a pause on some of the tariffs‚Äîwithout Navarro there to argue or push back. They knew they had a tight window. The meeting with Bessent and Lutnick wasn‚Äôt on Trump‚Äôs schedule.
>
>The two men convinced Trump of the strategy to pause some of the tariffs and to announce it immediately to calm the markets. They stayed until Trump tapped out a Truth Social post, which surprised Navarro, according to one of the people familiar with the episode. Bessent and press secretary Karoline Leavitt almost immediately went to the cameras outside the White House to make a public announcement. 

So the Liberation Day steep tariff percentages were only put on a 90-day pause because Navarro was in a different room on that April 9th morning

popular,AITAH for calling my husband a disgrace after he said my miscarriage ruined his birthday,"TW - loss

I miscarried yesterday afternoon about 12pm. I‚Äôve never had a miscarriage before and this baby was so wished for so it‚Äôs all so fresh and I‚Äôm sobbing right now so I apologise in advance if it doesn‚Äôt make a whole lot of sense. My husband turned 27 yesterday. 

I 26F *was* pregnant with mine and my husband‚Äôs 27M 2nd child. Yesterday, I was 8 weeks pregnant. The day before yesterday we saw a beautiful heart beat flicking on the screen and today I‚Äôm devastated. I was playing with our 2 year old when I felt a pressure in my lower abdomen. Not long later, I noticed bleeding and I let my husband know immediately that I had discomfort and bleeding. Before long I had passed what I believe is the fetus and I messaged him ‚ÄúI think I lost the baby‚Äù. I wanted to keep him updated and I guess I was seeking some kind of emotional support. I asked if he could come home and he said ‚Äúof course, if it‚Äôs urgent‚Äù. I said I think it is because the pain and bleeding is getting worse and I‚Äôm starting to feel lightheaded and our 2 year old is unattended in his playroom right now. We have no friends or family near that I could call who would get to us quicker than he could. 

I had to clean myself up, crawl down stairs to take paracetamol, make my son his lunch and then put him down for a nap. At this point my husband still isn‚Äôt home. He was working approx 30 mins away and took closer to 60 mins to get back. Hours later when I asked, it was because he‚Äôd stopped at Tesco to pick up some beers. 

I ended up very poorly, losing lots of blood, lightheaded, vomiting etc and he had to take me to A&E. By the time I was discharged it was almost 8pm. Last week, I had said I‚Äôd make him his favourite dinner for his birthday which he reminded me when we were almost home. I said I wasn‚Äôt feeling up to it and that whatever takeaway he wants is on me. He said ‚Äúfor fuck sake‚Äù under his breath and then muttered something along the lines of ‚Äúthis bullshit has ruined my birthday‚Äù. He didn‚Äôt stop to get any takeaway. He just drove straight home. He put our son to bed and I went to bed and I‚Äôm not sure what he did after. I didn‚Äôt see him this morning as he had already left for work. He‚Äôs not messaged me all day and he got home a few hours ago (it‚Äôs now 8. 40pm) and he‚Äôs been giving me silent treatment. I tried to speak to him about an hour or so ago and he ignored me and I called him a disgrace. He slammed the bedroom door and locked me out of the bedroom. His mum has since messaged me and said I need to be patient as he‚Äôs also had a loss. She didn‚Äôt ask how I was or anything. He‚Äôs obviously speaking to his mum but why isn‚Äôt he opening up and speaking to me? She said I was harsh?

I‚Äôm feeling utterly emotionally neglected right now. My body has been through emotional and physical hell. I understand that my miscarriage came at a fucking inconvenient time for him as it was his birthday and all. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs the hormones making me feel crazy but is it nuts to contemplate divorce?

popular,AITA for leaving my bf bday dinner after his mom took my seat?,"AITA for leaving my boyfriend‚Äôs birthday dinner after his mom took my seat ‚Äúas a joke‚Äù?

I (25F) have been dating my boyfriend Matt (27M) for almost two years. His family is *very* close, and his mom in particular has always been a little‚Ä¶ possessive? I‚Äôve tried not to make a big deal out of it, but it‚Äôs clear she doesn‚Äôt like that I ‚Äútake up his time,‚Äù and she‚Äôs made passive-aggressive comments like, ‚ÄúI hope I don‚Äôt lose my son to some girl,‚Äù even though we‚Äôve been together for a while and I‚Äôve made every effort to be kind and respectful to her.

Anyway, last weekend was Matt‚Äôs birthday. He invited me to dinner with his family at a nice restaurant. I dressed up, got him a gift I knew he‚Äôd love, and was honestly looking forward to the night.

When we arrived, I noticed his mom had saved the seat right next to him for herself. That‚Äôs fine, whatever ‚Äî I sat on his other side.

But right before we ordered, his mom made a ‚Äújoke‚Äù about how I always need to be next to Matt and said, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs see how you handle a little separation!‚Äù Then she literally stood up, looked at me, and said, ‚ÄúScooch, sweetie,‚Äù motioning for me to move down a seat so she could sit between us.

Everyone at the table laughed ‚Äî Matt included.

I was so stunned I just quietly got up and moved. For about five minutes I sat there, feeling small and humiliated while she leaned over Matt like he was her date.

So I stood up, grabbed my bag, and said, ‚ÄúActually, I think I‚Äôm gonna head out. Hope you have a great birthday, Matt.‚Äù And I left.

Matt blew up my phone later saying I *completely overreacted*, embarrassed him in front of his family, and ‚Äúcan‚Äôt take a joke.‚Äù His mom texted me a ‚Äúsorry you were so sensitive‚Äù message, which just made it worse.

Now he‚Äôs not speaking to me until I apologize. I honestly feel like they were the rude ones ‚Äî but it *was* his birthday dinner, so now I‚Äôm second-guessing everything.

popular,"Euch ist nicht klar, wie viel eures Geld wirklich an die alte Generation flie√üt.","Letztens kam mir ein Gedanke: Als arbeitende Bev√∂lkerung zahlen wir nicht nur Rentenversicherungsbeitr√§ge f√ºr die √§ltere Generation. In Deutschland flie√üt noch viel mehr unserer Produktivit√§t an Rentner. Weil mich das am Wochenende besch√§ftigt hat, habe ich eine einfache Website erstellt, auf der ihr sehen k√∂nnt, wie viel eures Gehalts an die √§ltere Generation geht: https://rentner.pages.dev/ . (Und ihr k√∂nnt sogar eine Urkunde ausdrucken! :D)
Folgendes wird oft √ºbersehen:

- Die Krankenkasse funktioniert in Deutschland ebenfalls als Umlageverfahren, und bereits heute flie√üen 51,4 % der Ausgaben an Menschen √ºber 65.
- Die Pflegeversicherung.
- Ein gro√üer Teil eurer Steuern im Bundeshaushalt (ca. 20 %) wird als Zuschuss f√ºr die Rentenversicherung verwendet.
- Mit euren Steuern werden auch Pensionen finanziert. 2023 beliefen sich die Ausgaben des Staates f√ºr Pensionen, Hinterbliebenenversorgung und Beihilfen auf rund 85,9 Milliarden Euro.
- 8,2 % des GEZ-Beitrags gehen f√ºr Betriebsrenten drauf.

Ich wei√ü, es fehlt noch einiges (z. B. Kapitalertr√§ge, Umsatzsteuer) und manches ist vereinfacht (z. B. Steuerklassen). Ja, das bezieht den Arbeitgeberanteil mit ein. Trotzdem soll es euch sensibilisieren: Das System ist jetzt schon grenzwertig und wird mit jedem Jahr kritischer.

Und jetzt das Interessante: Die arbeitende Bev√∂lkerung scheint das gar nicht √§ndern zu wollen. Bei der letzten Bundestagswahl hat die Linke bei jungen W√§hlern den ersten Platz geholt. Die Linke will die Renten erh√∂hen, eine Mindestrente einf√ºhren, die √ºber dem heutigen Durchschnitt liegt, und das Renteneintrittsalter senken.

all,I cleaned the shower before going out for a night of reading at a local bar. My partner has no idea that that sequence of events just ended our 6 year relationship.,"Nearly 3 years of living in this spot and I can't remember if he's cleaned the damn thing once. He's lied about cleaning it after cleaning litter boxes and I would literally hop in to shower and feel the nastiness still sitting there in a layer of slime and grossness. I went on strike and haven't touched it and finally broke today.

Today I'm going out for live music and some reading at a local spot. I told myself I'd clean the litter boxes today so, before showering, I decided to dump em and scrub em in the shower. While sitting there, looking at the orange slime that has built up around the tub, I decided that I was finally done. 

Cleaned the litter boxes, sprayed down the tub and walls and curtain, then hopped in and scrubbed the whole thing down before cleaning myself. 

I rinsed brown/brackish water off of the walls multiple times. Scrubbed the orange slime away, and when I was done in the time I had it was STILL barely passable. It was sick. I can't believe I've been showering in this mess all while begging and pleading for this grown ass man to just fucking HELP OUT with the nasty ass apartment we have together. The kicker? He gets mad at ME when I get upset about things üòÇ apparently not using your Super Special Big Boy Cleanup Time Voice  and instead getting frustrated that a 28 year old man doesn't help out more makes you an evil bitch who doesn't understand how rude they are to people. Go figure. 

Anyway. Im done. I don't even think he realizes. I just continued getting ready and went along with my plans and walked out the door with barely a ""see you later"". I was arguing with him silently in my head the rest of the time but didn't even bother starting up for real because it genuinely was not worth ruining my night. 

Anyway. I just needed to get this off my chest. There's so much more I could rant about but having this feeling of being like ""actually, screw this. Im done.""

popular,AITAH for cancelling our date because she was 15 minutes late?,"I connected with someone on a dating app, and after a while of texting we agreed to a restaurant date as our first time meeting in real life.

To clarify: In my profile i have listed people not being on time as my biggest red flag, In our chat I talked about how punctuality is a really important virtue to me, and when we planned the date I specifically told her to text me should something come up or If there are any delays.

Come the time and day of the date and she isnt there. I wait and check my phone and she hadnt texted me anything. She finally arrives 15 minutes late.
She greets me but doesnt even apologize for being late. I ask her why she was late.
She shrugs and says that taking ready just took longer than expected. I ask her If before she drove here she already knew she wouldnt make it in time. She says yes. I ask her why she didnt text me. She said she didnt because she was only ""a little late"", and started looking visibly annnoyed.

At that point I excused myself, said our values dont align and left her there.

She proceeded to shout after me and blew up my phone before I unmatched her when I got home.

AITA? 
I just have absolutely zero tolerance for not being on time without good reason, especially when you dont even communicate it properly or arent even sorry about it, and I know my standards are harsh but I feel like I was very open about it and gave plenty of warnings.",9619.0,5813.0,2025-04-22 21:31:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1k5f956/aitah_for_cancelling_our_date_because_she_was_15/,aitah cancel date 15 minute late,11,62,5.636363636363637,-0.3,0.6,connect someone date app texting agree restaurant date first time meet real life clarify profile list people not time biggest red flag chat talk punctuality really important virtue plan date specifically tell text something come delay come time day date isnt wait check phone hadnt texted anything finally arrive 15 minute late greet doesnt even apologize late ask late shrug say take ready take longer expect ask drive already know wouldnt make time say yes ask didnt text say didnt little late start look visibly annnoyed point excuse say value dont align leave proceed shout blow phone unmatched get home aita absolutely zero tolerance not time without good reason especially dont even communicate properly arent even sorry know standard harsh feel like open give plenty warning,272,1407,5.172794117647059,-0.011309523809523806,0.5896825396825397,0.11288372281252457
popular,FINAL WARNING: Pierre Poilievre Is a Danger to Canada,"**FINAL WARNING: Pierre Poilievre Is a Danger to Canada**  
*This is a direct message to every Canadian who values truth, compassion, and democracy.*

Canada is on the brink of catastrophe. This upcoming federal election isn‚Äôt just another round at the ballot box ‚Äî it is the most important election of your lifetime. This is the moment that will define who we are as a country. This is your *final warning*.

¬† and the Conservative Party are not just wrong for Canada ‚Äî they are a **threat** to everything Canada stands for. If you think we‚Äôre exaggerating, look south of the border. The United States ignored the warnings. They embraced Donald Trump, a narcissistic, authoritarian figure propped up by billionaires and conspiracy theorists. Their democracy has never recovered. And now, we are staring down a mirror image of that disaster ‚Äî right here, at home, in Pierre Poilievre.

Make no mistake: **Pierre Poilievre is Canada's Trump.**  
He idolizes Donald Trump. He echoes the same rhetoric. He amplifies the same hate. He promotes the same division and chaos. And now, he has cozied up to **Elon Musk**, one of the richest men alive, who has shown blatant disregard for truth, workers' rights, or public good ‚Äî just like Poilievre.

**Here‚Äôs what Pierre Poilievre truly stands for:**

* **Anti-union**: Poilievre has consistently voted *against* workers‚Äô rights and *against* union protections. He has no interest in protecting the working class ‚Äî his loyalty lies with CEOs, not you.
* **Wants to cut the federal dental plan**, which helps millions of Canadians. Under his leadership, the working class will suffer while the wealthy celebrate.
* **Plans to slash healthcare**, pushing us toward a privatized system where only the rich get proper care.
* **Will gut public services**, laying off public sector workers and slashing budgets that keep our communities safe and supported.
* **Will sell us out**: He will **bow to Trump**, **sell our industries to the U.S.**, and even make backroom deals with **China**, putting our sovereignty and economy at risk.
* **Does not value women**: He has a history of ignoring women's rights, supporting regressive policies, and surrounding himself with misogynistic voices.
* **Has spread lies**: His entire campaign is built on *fabricated numbers*, *false promises*, and *gaslighting the public*.
* **Supports extremist ideologies**: He‚Äôs flirted with conspiracy theorists and has amplified hate-filled voices.
* **Anti-science, anti-progress**: From climate denial to blocking advancements in green jobs, he drags Canada backward.
* **Opposes reconciliation with Indigenous peoples**, showing disregard for justice, truth, and healing.
* **Wants to criminalize dissent**, clamping down on protests and threatening your right to speak up.
* **Pushes culture wars**, division, and fear over unity and hope.
* **Wants to turn our media into state-run mouthpieces** or destroy them altogether.
* **Stokes racism and division**, because he knows hate wins votes when truth doesn‚Äôt.
* **He will not govern ‚Äî he will rule**, and if elected, democracy as we know it will never be the same.

This is not fear-mongering. This is *reality*.

**If you are thinking about voting for Pierre Poilievre, understand this:**

¬†¬†

This is not about left vs. right anymore ‚Äî this is about **Canada vs. collapse**.

¬†  
If you haven‚Äôt voted yet ‚Äî **vote to protect your country, your community, your children‚Äôs future.**  
Do not fall for his lies. Do not become a cautionary tale. Open your eyes, Canada. Wake up, before it‚Äôs too late.

Because when democracy dies, it never announces itself with a bang. It dies slowly ‚Äî through the election of men like Pierre Poilievre, while good people stay silent.

popular,It's time to start being blatantly rude to those with no situational and spatial awareness,"I don't know if I'm just noticing it more and more, or if this is actually becoming more of a problem, but there are SO many people wandering around in the world with a complete lack of awareness of what's happening around them. 

I'm talking about the type of people who block entire aisles in grocery stores, who stop in front of doors, who walk three people side by side by side on the sidewalk and expect everyone else to walk on the road or mud to get around them. People who walk against the flow of traffic, who block the width of a busy escalator then stop as soon as they step off, or who just wander into a crosswalk without even looking to see if a car is coming.

We need to stop accommodating these people by being polite and thoughtful and considerate. We need to start being blatant assholes to them, because nothing else we do seems to be working. Don't say ""excuse me"", say ""get out of the way."" Don't skirt around a group of people blocking an entire pathway - walk through the middle of their group. Shove their carts out of the way when they're blocking the entire aisle. Tell them to put their f\*cking phone away.

popular,AITA for refusing to cover my tattoos for my boyfriend‚Äôs family dinner?,"I‚Äôm (21F) a girl who has several tattoos (some big and quite visible), my boyfriend (26M) met me like that and I hadn't had any problem with it.  
He invited me to go to dinner with his family and I accepted, but he casually mentioned, ‚ÄúMaybe you could wear something with sleeves? Just so we don‚Äôt start any drama.‚Äù I asked what he meant, and he said his grandparents are very old-school and might not react well to my tattoos. He said he didn‚Äôt want the night to be awkward.  
I told him I wasn‚Äôt going to hide part of myself to make his family more comfortable. He said it‚Äôs not about hiding, it‚Äôs about respect. I told him respect goes both ways, and I shouldn‚Äôt have to pretend to be someone I‚Äôm not.  
He got upset and said I was overreacting and making it a bigger deal than it is. I told him that I would go to the dinner but that I wouldn't cover my tattoos. But then he asked me to please not attend, that if I was only going to be difficult, it would be better not to be there.  
That really rubbed me the wrong way and made me feel confused, because I think maybe I did behave badly and I shouldn't have reacted so vehemently against the idea. I don't want to cause drama with his family, but I have had a hard time feeling comfortable in my skin and learning to deal with the stigma people have towards me because of my tattoos... and I don't want to go back and hide again, plus I don't think I would be honest with his family either if I show myself as I am not.

popular,YSK How to stop a dog attack.,"Why YSK: After seeing multiple posts about dog attacks and people in the comments giving absolutely terrible advice, you should know the only proven way to stop a dog attack is by oxygen deprivation.

Using a spare lead, pass the rope or cord under the attacking dog‚Äôs neck, then pass it through the loop and cinch it tight like a noose. Hold it until the dog releases it‚Äôs target either for air or until it passes out.

Do not use your hands to try to pry the dog‚Äôs mouth open. Do not try to make loud noises as it will likely heighten the attacking dog. Do not try to use your own body to attempt to subdue the dog whether by holding it down or trying to choke it yourself. For god sake don‚Äôt stick your finger up it‚Äôs butt. The only way is to force the dog to try to breathe by depriving it of oxygen.

Edit: This is advice for a dog attacking another dog or animal. If you suspect a dog may attack you try get up high like on a car. If the attack is imminent, cross your arms against your chest & try to maintain your stance & hope it loses interest. If you are pulled to the ground maintain crossed arms, ball-up, & protect your vital organs & face & pray it loses interest or someone can help.",9341.0,1248.0,2025-04-22 22:15:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/1k5gc9o/ysk_how_to_stop_a_dog_attack/,ysk stop dog attack,7,29,4.142857142857143,0.0,0.0,ysk see multiple post dog attack people comment give absolutely terrible advice know prove way stop dog attack oxygen deprivation use spare lead pas rope cord attack dog neck pas loop cinch tight like noose hold dog release target either air pas not use hand try pry dog mouth open not try make loud noise likely heighten attack dog not try use body attempt subdue dog whether hold try choke god sake stick finger butt way force dog try breathe deprive oxygen edit advice dog attack another dog animal suspect dog may attack try get high like car attack imminent cross arm chest try maintain stance hope lose interest pull grind maintain cross arm ball protect vital organ face pray lose interest someone help,234,1199,5.1239316239316235,-0.06494179894179893,0.5343068783068783,0.024956411540981157
popular,Tesla reports disappointing quarterly results as automotive revenue plunges 20%,"Tesla¬†reported a miss on the top and bottom lines in its first-quarter earnings report on Tuesday as automotive revenue plunged 20% from a year earlier.

Here are the key numbers compared with LSEG expectations.

* **Earnings per share**: 27 cents adjusted vs. 39 cents estimated
* **Revenue**: $19.34 billion vs. $21.11 billion estimated

Total revenue slid 9% from $21.3 billion a year earlier. Automotive revenue dropped 20% to $14 billion from $17.4 billion in the same period last year.

Tesla said one reason for the decline was the need to update lines at its four vehicle factories to start making a refreshed version of its popular Model Y SUV. The company also pointed to lower average selling prices and sales incentives as a drag on revenue and profit.

Net income plummeted 71% to $409 million, or 12 cents a share, from $1.39 billion or 41 cents a year ago.

It‚Äôs been a brutal start to the year for Tesla, with CEO¬†Elon Musk¬†spending much of his time in¬†President Donald Trump‚Äôs White House, overseeing an effort to dramatically downsize the federal government. The president‚Äôs sweeping tariffs plan has led to concerns that costs will increase for parts and materials crucial for electric vehicle production, including manufacturing equipment,¬†automotive glass, printed circuit boards and battery cells.

Tesla shares are down 41% so far in 2025, and suffered their worst quarterly drop since 2022 in the period that ended in March. The stock was little changed in extended trading on Tuesday.

The company refrained from promising growth this year and said it will ‚Äúrevisit our 2025 guidance in our Q2 update.‚Äù

In its shareholder deck, Tesla cautioned investors that ‚Äúuncertainty in the automotive and energy markets continues to increase as rapidly evolving trade policy adversely impacts the global supply chain and cost structure of Tesla and our peers.‚Äù The company said this ‚Äúdynamic,‚Äù and ‚Äúchanging political sentiment‚Äù could have a meaningful near-term impact on demand for its products.

Tesla has faced widespread protests in the U.S. and Europe, where Musk has actively supported Germany‚Äôs far-right AfD party. Earlier this month, the company¬†reported¬†a 13% decline in first quarter deliveries from a year earlier to 336,681.

Tesla has been struggling to keep pace with lower-cost competitors in China, and is a laggard in the robotaxi market, which is currently dominated in the U.S. by¬†Alphabet‚Äôs¬†Waymo. The company has promised to launch its¬†first driverless ride-hailing offering¬†in Austin, Texas, in June.

The company reassured investors on Tuesday that it remains on track for a ‚Äúpilot launch‚Äù in Austin by that point, and to begin building its humanoid robots on a pilot production line in Fremont, California, this year.

Operating income in the quarter slid 66% to $400 million from $1.17 billion a year earlier, resulting in a 2.1% operating margin. The company cited an increase in expenses tied to artificial intelligence projects as one factor in the decline.

The company would have lost money on automotive sales without environmental regulatory credits during the quarter. Revenue from the credits, which Tesla receives for selling fully electric vehicles, increased to $595 million from $432 million in the same quarter last year.

Energy generation and storage revenue jumped 67% in the quarter to $2.73 billion from $1.64 billion a year ago. The company said growth in AI infrastructure is ‚Äúcreating an outsized opportunity for our Energy storage products to stabilize the grid, shift energy when it is needed most and provide additional power capacity.‚Äù

Tesla uses foreign suppliers for its energy business. The company said ‚Äúincreasing tariffs may cause market volatility and near-term impacts to supply and demand.‚Äù

all,AITA for bringing a much older guy to Easter dinner after my dad left my mom for someone close to my age?,"I (18F) moved out at 15 when I got into a boarding school abroad. When I was 12, my dad (45M) cheated on my mom (43F) with a woman (26F) who was 20 at the time. They ended up divorcing, and he‚Äôs been with her ever since. She‚Äôs only a few years older than me, and for the past few years, she‚Äôs been at every family holiday. She‚Äôs clearly only after his money, but hes too stupid and stubborn to understand. 

This year, for Easter, I flew back home and asked a friend of mine (38M) to come with me and pretend to be my boyfriend just for a few days at my home. 

After dinner, my dad pulled me aside and told me he felt uncomfortable with the situation. I told him I didn‚Äôt do anything wrong and that, after him, love has no age. He told me that I ruined everyones Easter by being selfish and bringing someone his age to dinner.

I flew back to school, but now I‚Äôm getting messages from a few relatives saying I should apologize to my dad and break up with my ‚Äúboyfriend.‚Äù I haven‚Äôt responded. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm in the wrong because hes made my life uncomfortable since the moment he cheated on my mom. 

AITA?

When i had no friends there he would buy me dinner and actually spend time with me, and hes recently divorced (from his hs sweetheart) so he would‚Äôve spent easter alone anyway, therefore decided to take him with and show him around.

all,The ‚Äúsupport strike‚Äù and Necros‚Äô comments ‚Äì why this actually matters,"With the recent ‚Äúsupport strike‚Äù going on in Marvel Rivals, I wanted to share an experience that really shows why many support players are speaking up and had enough right now.

Necros outright said on stream that he hates support players and called them ‚Äúidiots‚Äù and ‚Äúmorons.‚Äù That kind of statement, coming from a big voice in the community, does real damage. Streamers don‚Äôt get to opt out of influence ‚Äî if you have a following, what you say matters in your community. And now we‚Äôre seeing the consequences of that.

In a recent match, I was playing support and I wasn‚Äôt doing bad ‚Äî nearly 50k healing, only two deaths, same damage blocked as our DPS, and just 10k less total damage dealt. Still, someone in voice chat told me: ‚ÄúNecros was right, you support players are all brain dead.‚Äù And that‚Äôs the exact problem. This mindset is being validated and amplified, and it makes playing the role feel increasingly thankless. 

To be clear, most support players aren‚Äôt playing support because they lack the mechanical skill to play DPS. They can play DPS ‚Äî just like there are mechanically easy and difficult heroes in every role. The reason a lot of us choose support is because it‚Äôs actually fulfilling and fun for us to keep a teammate alive, or to set someone else up for a kill. For us, that‚Äôs just more fun than chasing elims.

We‚Äôre not asking to be glorified or seen as the ‚Äúhardest‚Äù role - because I don‚Äôt think we are. We just want basic respect. It‚Äôs tiring to be called brain dead or worthless when your stats are solid and you‚Äôre playing your role the way it‚Äôs meant to be played.

Honestly, the players who show appreciation are usually tanks.(Especially non-dive/frontline tanks) They know they‚Äôd go down in seconds without healing. But a lot of this support hate seems to come from DPS mains, who can usually get by on health packs and mobility.

If you‚Äôre someone who plays DPS or tank, take a second to think about the support on your team. Are they really the problem ‚Äî or are they just an easy target? This game doesn‚Äôt work without teamwork, so if your support is getting dove a lot stay with them and protect them, you keeping your support alive, and preventing the enemy teams divers from getting kills is still great value for your team.",2947.0,323.0,2025-04-23 12:11:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1k5vjdy/the_support_strike_and_necros_comments_why_this/,support strike necros comment actually matter,11,69,6.2727272727272725,0.0,0.1,recent support strike go marvel rival want share experience really show many support player speak enough right necros outright say stream hat support player call idiot moron kind statement come big voice community real damage streamer get opt influence follow say matter community see consequence recent match play support bad nearly 50k heal two death damage block dp 10k less total damage deal still someone voice chat tell necros right support player brain dead exact problem mindset validate amplify make play role feel increasingly thankless clear support player play support lack mechanical skill play dp play dp like mechanically easy difficult hero every role reason lot u choose support actually fulfil fun u keep teammate alive set someone else kill u fun chase elims not ask glorify see hardest role think want basic respect tire call brain dead worthless stats solid play role way mean play honestly player show appreciation usually tank especially non dive frontline tank know go second without heal lot support hate seem come dp main usually get health pack mobility someone play dp tank take second think support team really problem easy target game work without teamwork support get dive lot stay protect keep support alive prevent enemy team diver get kill still great value team,404,2263,5.601485148514851,0.01701940035273369,0.45430335097001745,0.020473086055025135

popular,AITAH for refusing to make my SIL‚Äôs wedding cake for free?,"I (29f) run a bakery business that I've built from the ground up during the past five years. It started as a hobby during college, but now it‚Äôs a registered business with steady clients, a dedicated workspace, and consistent orders during each month. 

I do mostly for weddings, birthdays, and other events. I take a lot of pride in what I do, and it‚Äôs not just ‚Äúbaking for fun‚Äù anymore. This is my livelihood.  

My SIL (33F) is getting married at the beginning of June. She‚Äôs my wife‚Äôs older sister. We‚Äôre on friendly terms, but she‚Äôs always had this vibe like she doesn‚Äôt really take what I do seriously.  

She‚Äôs made comments like, ‚ÄúIt must be nice getting to play in the kitchen all day,‚Äù or, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre lucky people will pay for something they could probably learn on YouTube.‚Äù Always with a smile, like it‚Äôs a joke but not really. 

I've brushed these comments off in the past, since they weren't happening all the time and I just didn't want to stir up any drama. 


So earlier this month, she asked if I‚Äôd make her wedding cake. I said sure and asked what she had in mind. She sent over inspo pics of a four-tier cake with smooth buttercream, floral piping, and real flowers on top and cascading down one side. 

She wanted it to be a chocolate sponge with raspberry filling in terms of taste. Plus, she wanted for me it to deliver to the venue myself on the morning of the wedding rather than picking it up the day before herself.

After we got done discussing everything, I gave her a quote over the phone with a generous family discount, and SIL replied almost instantly, that she didn't think I'd be charging her and the cake would essentially be a wedding gift. 

I told her that I don‚Äôt typically do wedding cakes as gifts because of how much time and work they take, but I‚Äôd be happy to buy her something from her registry instead or still make the cake at the discounted price if she wanted.

She wasn‚Äôt happy. Said I was being transactional and that it was just a cake and I clearly didn‚Äôt want to be part of her special day before hanging up on me. 

To be clear, I have made cakes for free before. But those were small, simple ones for people I care about, or for friends who were going through a rough time.  This isn't that  my SIL and her fiance can pay for the cake, and it's not like she's exactly respected my work in the past. 


Meanwhile, SIL has been telling anyone who will listen that I‚Äôm making her big day about myself and trying to ‚Äúprofit off her happiness.‚Äù Seriously. 

My MIL called and she didn‚Äôt really ask how I felt or try to understand where I was coming from, she just seemed overwhelmed and kind of desperate to stop this from turning into a bigger family fight. She kept going on about how stressed my SIL was and how she was being a bit much, but basically begged me to reconsider.

popular,My best friend married the dumbest woman I have ever met and it's ruined our friendship,"They've been together since they were in high school, and I'm convinced he never thought he could do better, so he just dealt with it. He became a doctor, and they have two kids, and she makes all the decisions about their care.

She doesn't want them to go to school because she doesn't trust what they teach them. She's homeschooling them even though she failed her teaching certification 3 times and gave up on that career. Their kids have no vaccines. When I asked my best friend why he admitted, he just didn't want to have the fight with his wife even though he's vaccinated and a professional in the medical field. I lost most of my respect for him.

It makes me really sad. We've known each other since middle school, and dude is a shell of that super intelligent ambitious guy he was. I told them I couldn't trust them to be godparents to my daughter since we fundamentally disagreed with how they are raising their kids. 20+ years of friendship is pretty much gone now.

Edit for extra info since some people wanted to know more. His wife was in education, and I say was because she was fired from multiple jobs as a teacher for poor performance. Last job demoted her twice from teacher to aide to library assistant before they let her go. She never got her teaching license, which was part of the reason she got demoted. She couldn't pass the certification exams no matter how often she took them. The last count was at 3 before she gave up on the profession. 

They weren't always like this in our early 20s. She was big into fashion and cosmetics. Competed in a few local pageants. She went into teaching because her mom was a teacher. They moved to a semi rural area and she became super devout. This was new because they were never like this but whatever. That's when the home schooling started along with the anti-science/vaccines. Autism runs on his side of the family. His brother is high functioning and highly skilled in robotics. Her sister has an autistic child, blames vaccines even though autism also runs on her husband's side of the family.

They were our daughters' godparents, which would make them legal guardians if anything were to happen to us. I couldn't in good conscious keep them as guardians because if he won't advocate for his kids knowing what he knows he won't advocate for mine.

Edit 2: Seen the comment that godparents doesn't make them legal guardians and wanted to clarify. We grew up in the Caribbean and the term godparents/legal guardians is interchangeable for us.

all,YSK The danger Measles poses is not primarily death from Measles itself.,"Why YSK.

Measles by itself is not highly lethal, but the danger it poses is serious for three reasons.

First, it is the most contagious disease known to humankind. The Spanish Flu had an infection rate of 1.5-2. Measles has an infection rate of 12-18.

Second, Measles can hide in the body for years, cross the blood-brain barrier, and cause death long after you forgot about it.

Third, the extreme danger of measles is what it does to your immune system. Throughout your life, as your body contracts and fights off diseases, it keeps a record of how to fight those diseases. Measles comes in and burns 20-70% of those records, so that the next time you catch a sniffle it might turn into a life-threatening lung infection.

popular,What‚Äôs one thing under $25 that significantly improved your daily life?,"I‚Äôve been thinking a lot lately about how small, inexpensive things can make a surprisingly big impact on quality of life. I‚Äôm not talking about fancy gadgets or big-ticket items‚Äîjust the little things that somehow make your day smoother, calmer, or a little more enjoyable.





For me, it was a $12 magnetic whiteboard I stuck to the fridge. Nothing fancy, but it became the central hub for my brain. Appointments, grocery needs, random thoughts‚Äîall of it lives there now. It‚Äôs helped my ADHD brain stay just a little more organized, and it‚Äôs saved me from forgetting things like my kid‚Äôs soccer practice or whether we‚Äôre out of milk.

Another one: a $6 scalp scrubber I got on a whim. I don‚Äôt know why it‚Äôs so satisfying, but every shower feels like a spa now. And I actually want to wash my hair more regularly, which is a win in my book.

I‚Äôve heard people swear by things like cheap kitchen timers to stay focused, $10 milk frothers to elevate their morning coffee, or simple $5 silicone jar openers that save your wrists.

So I‚Äôm curious‚Äîwhat‚Äôs your small-but-mighty upgrade? What‚Äôs something under $25 that made your life better in a noticeable, lasting way?

popular,YSK The danger Measles poses is not primarily death from Measles itself.,"Why YSK.

Measles by itself is not highly lethal, but the danger it poses is serious for three reasons.

First, it is the most contagious disease known to humankind. The Spanish Flu had an infection rate of 1.5-2. Measles has an infection rate of 12-18.

Second, Measles can hide in the body for years, cross the blood-brain barrier, and cause death long after you forgot about it.

Third, the extreme danger of measles is what it does to your immune system. Throughout your life, as your body contracts and fights off diseases, it keeps a record of how to fight those diseases. Measles comes in and burns 20-70% of those records, so that the next time you catch a sniffle it might turn into a life-threatening lung infection.

popular,AITAH for playing a voice recording to prove to my friend her daughter isn‚Äôt nonverbal?,"So I (30f) have a friend (34f) that has a ‚Äúnon-verbal‚Äù daughter (3f) let‚Äôs call her Allie. I watch her 4 days out of the week in my in-home daycare.

 **I require contracts for every child and she never filled out the special needs section. And at no point when she asked me to take Allie did she mention any type of speech delay or non speaking issue..** 

Although Allie didn‚Äôt speak much at first (I figured she was shy) she communicated her needs to me very well and said small things to me frequently. Last month I was in the bathroom (I keep the door BARELY cracked with a wedge so I can listen for any dangers and they can‚Äôt walk in on me or see me) she walked by and said ‚ÄúEw you stinky‚Äù. I laughed and told her mom at pickup what she said and I was met with ‚ÄúSHE ISNT VERBAL WHY WOULD YOU MOCK HER‚Äù I reassured her that Allie has spoken to me quite a few times and I thought that it was a huge milestone from when she first arrived and was barely saying anything. She told me she didn‚Äôt believe me and that it was messed up that I would make up something like that to upset her. I told her that I wasn‚Äôt trying to upset her but I wasn‚Äôt lying either. I didn‚Äôt press the issue further. 

Here‚Äôs where I might be the AH. I decided to record Allie (a voice recording, not her face) telling me her name and what her favorite animal is. 

** I had full intention of showing mom the recording, but I was scared at first because of her blowup at me and I didn‚Äôt know how she would react. After a few short pickups and drop offs she told me it was water under the bridge and that she didn‚Äôt want to talk about it anymore. She even insisted that I went to the birthday party. After that I was just happy Allie could continue and I ended up forgetting I had the recording at all. 

Fast forward to Friday (about a month later) she had a birthday party for her other child. At the party I was socializing with other family members (Honestly I‚Äôm a total dumbass for forgetting that her family fully thought that she was nonverbal) I mentioned the funny things Allie has said to me while we were reading an animal book. Turns out the person I was talking to was her sister and she started yelling at me saying ‚ÄúSHE IS NON-VERBAL WHY ARE YOU LYING‚Äù. Both her and her sister start berating me saying that it‚Äôs f*cked up that I‚Äôm making this up about Allie being verbal. At this point I‚Äôm tired of being called a liar. I have two disabled children whom my son was non-verbal for many years. I wouldn‚Äôt lie about something like this. So while everybody was staring at me I was scared and felt backed into a corner. So I (remembering I had the recording) decided to prove my case and play the voice recording. Everybody was shocked and my friend told me to leave. I told her I didn‚Äôt want to cause issues but I‚Äôm not gonna be berated and called a liar. She said that I crossed the line recording her daughter and that I‚Äôm an a**hole for embarrassing her at the party. Now I feel horrible and wondering if I should have just let it go..

Edit for clarification and extra context: 

Whenever she would pickup and drop off she wouldn‚Äôt ask me much other than ‚Äúhow was her nap, how much did she eat‚Äù and I would hand her the daily report then she would leave and not stay for small talk even when I would try to initiate.  
I know people have busy lives so I‚Äôm not gonna try to make them stay and talk to me about their life story. 

I also didn‚Äôt do the recording to embarrass her in any way. I didn‚Äôt mean any vindication by it. I can admit I should have shown her immediately after I recorded it but I‚Äôm also human and I was afraid of a second blow up. Then after her saying it was water under the bridge I was just happy that she wasn‚Äôt gonna take Allie away so I put it in the back of my mind and forgot about it. 

I feel bad about how I went about my defense (hence the post). I know it was unprofessional and unethical. I apologized profusely to everybody at the party and the family as well. 

I will be putting cameras in my home that everybody will have access to as well as updating all the contracts to let parents know what is going to happen going forward. Peace of mind for everybody sounds good to me! Also, I will be making a call to cps about the situation and see what they have to say.

Deep.

I‚Äôm panicking, but trying to stay calm. My girlfriend‚Äôs next to me trying to help, but then she says, ‚ÄúOMG you‚Äôre bleeding!‚Äù
MA‚ÄôAM THAT‚ÄôS NOT CALMING ME DOWN.

Tried flushing it out with water. Warm water. Tilted head. Slapped the shit out of myself trying to get this thing out I did All the google DIY nonsense. Nope. Still feel it flapping around in there like it paid rent.

All urgent cares are closed, it‚Äôs like 1AM, so I go to the ER. Wait time? 4 hours. Nurse says, ‚Äúyou can just come back in the morning or try to go to urgent care after they open since im not in any pain (physical that  is)

So  I Go home. Bug‚Äôs probably dead now. My ear feels like a haunted cave.

Meanwhile, this is literally the first day I could fully put on my Crocs because of my gout foot.

popular,"AITAH for basically telling my in laws this is my house, if you don't like my rules get out.","First off I don't think I was wrong which has infuriated my girlfriend.

I (25) recently moved into my house. My girlfriend (27) and I had a little housewarming. Her family, my mother and a few of our friends.

We were eating outdoors and the kids had their own table. My girlfriend's nephew (8) knocked over a jug of dilute. I was at the table when it happened and it was clearly an accident. He was very polite and apologised. He was a little upset but I just laughed it off.

His father came over and I was shocked at how much his father gave out to him. I told him it was only an accident etc and he kept going.  I felt really guilty for not stopping it. He ran over to the corner of the garden and started crying.

His father went back to the table and he said what happened and his wife said he deserved that, he should stay there a long time or something along those lines. There was almost a snigger from some of her family.

Anyway I went over to the boy a couple of minutes later. I gave him a bar of chocolate. He was still crying. He said sorry again. I gave him a high five and taught him this high five I used to do as a kid.

His mother came over and said do you mind not talking to my son. He needs to think about what he did wrong and he needs to do that alone.

I took her and her husband aside and said this is my house, if you want to upset your kid dont do it here. If you don't like it get out. I swear the reaction that followed was insane. They went back to the table saying it. My mom said (never holding back) didn't I raise a great son. He's spot on not to let bullies in his house. Which erupted it even more.

My girlfriend spoke to me in private and asked me to apologise to them. I said no. I stand by what I said and (this part I regret a bit) I told her I think less of her for even asking me to apologise. A mate of mine and his son kicked ball with the boy and I. He actually gave me a hug (i dont do hugs) at the end of the party and said sorry again. He hugged so tightly for a couple of seconds. 

I really could go on about the drama but in short her family thought I was wrong. I was getting little digs etc. My girlfriend's friend came up privately and said I was right to step in.

My girlfriend is still pushing for me to apologise. I still don't think I did anything wrong. I didn't tell them how to parent but told them to leave if that's how they want to parent. If I'm being completely honest (i didnt say this), I'm not sure I'd want a kid with a family like that.

Honkai Star Rail:

* Mentioned that he wasn't very satisfied with what the team did with Amphoreus; the team's creative desire was too high, with many unnecessary designs.
* Elysia was designed by the former president of the NCTU Animation Club.
* Will check social media but not constantly, because there are many extreme voices; the data team can verify some community things.
* Our game rarely has clipping issues, which is supported by AI technology.
* After the 3.2 release, there was an internal meeting - originally they wanted to give a chance to see how the anniversary version content would perform, but in the end they still felt the version content wasn't good enough.

Some other Stuff:

* Made several investments when young, randomly invested purely out of personal interest, e.g., brain-computer interface, nuclear fusion, COMAC (Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China) - later didn't really manage these investments much.
* Particularly invested in brain-computer interfaces because a NCTU professor also wanted to start a business.
* The nuclear fusion project was done by an American-educated returnee classmate - with just one PowerPoint presentation, they conned Da Wei out of ""small goal,"" and then when they ran out of money, they conned him out of another ""small goal"" with another PowerPoint. (Note: ""a small goal"" is a Chinese meme referring to 100 million RMB).
* The Host: ""Jack Ma said having money doesn't bring happiness, so are you happy?"", Da Wei: ""Yes, I'm happy.""
* There was once a company that we didn't think could succeed at all, but they still managed to create their product and defeated us in 2019, that was Arknights.
* Metioned Sumeru in Genshin and the beginning of Zenless Zone Zero weren't great.

About campus recruitment:

* As the boss, doesn't know exactly how many people will be recruited this year, but miHoYo campus recruitment is really competitive - even Cai Miao (one of the original founders besides Da Wei) secretly participated in the written test but didn't pass.
* One person who applied for miHoYo campus recruitment knew more about miHoYo than all the interviewers, so they hired him directly.
* After many people were recruited, Da Wei sighed: ""Why would a great person like you want to end up in our company""

popular,Coworker found me on a dating app and won't let it go. What do I do?,"I am a female that works in a primarily male dominated field. I truly love my job, it's probably the best one I've had by far. Here's the coworker issue: one of my coworkers found me on a dating app. Well, he said his brother found me and asked him if he worked with me, due to my specification of the industry I worked in/my location. I wasn't working the day he made this discovery. Upon finding out I was on said dating app, he made it a point to let EVERYONE know I was. I found it odd. Why should he or anyone else care? I then realized it was in a ""damn she's desperate"" fashion. Not only is the workplace and field in general male dominated, but I am more than 20 years younger than the majority of my coworkers- with the exception of the guy who spread the info and a couple others. 

I didn't care initially, I presumed it would blow over; but it indeed has not. He and a few others bring it up in a mocking or teasing way quite regularly. It really wasn't funny the first time, and it definitely wasn't the second, third, or fourth time. I want to highlight that the intention does not feel playful, but instead is delivered in a very demeaning way. I will occasionally get unsolicited advice on my appearance from the same coworker.

I'm looking for advice on what I can do in this situation without turning it into an HR fiasco. I only plan to stay at this job until mid 2026. I want to make my next year enjoyable. What should I say next time he or another coworker brings it up? Something that will really embarrass them perhaps? Any advice is appreciated, thanks.

popular,My mortgage is completely paid off!,"Yesterday was my last mortgage payment (and it was just a fraction of what I paid every week--$90 instead of $450). I (55 3/4 F) bought the house on my own in 2008. I paid the mortgage every week long before I got married, then as the primary/only breadwinner afterwards. And I'm both proud & relieved to be done.

Here's where the old person yelling comes in. Television trained me to believe that there would be some kind of document that I could burn to mark the milestone. There isn't (yet? Maybe I'll get some kind of doc from the bank in the mail?).

Instead, as I do all my banking online, and the payment comes out at the end of the day, I had to look at that $90 balance for days and days. Then this morning, I logged in hoping to see the account balance at zero. My plan was to screenshot it and send it to those in my life who'd celebrate with me, virtually. 

And yet... log in and the account was gone! Not zero, but disappeared. I'm happy it's gone, but I feel shafted on the celebratory experience. Any other GenXers let down by hitting this milestone without anything to bote it?

popular,AITAH for not selling my neighbor a thrifted rocking chair I JUST BOUGHT?,"I honestly have no words.  I (27)  just bought my house in july 2024.  We have learned that most of the neighbors are all old as hell.( i think these neighbors are 60s +) and are very nosey and onery that young families are moving into the neighborhood in recent years. They will just walk up to you and tell you this. 

I have been shopping thrift and estate sales to furnish this cute house. This morning, I came home from an estate sale with a BEAUTIFUL wingbacked rocking chair. (It needs to be reuplostered as the leather that was on it is in terrible condition and the previous owner started pulling it off. ) 

Im unloading it from the bed of my truck when neighbor , Carol,  sticks her giraffe neck over the fence and starts squawking about how beautiful it is . I said thanks i got it at an estate sale for $10! This triggered the parasites in her brain and she, i shit you not, teleported over to the truck. She starts going off about how much she needs a chair to rock her grandkids to sleep in and how much she would appreciate it if it was hers. I told her I got it for my future babies to be rocked to sleep in and that it still  needs lots of work before it can be used. Mind you this chair is large and she is very small. 

This is when she starts offering me money ($15 because "" its more than what you paid for it"") then telling me i dont need it because i dont have kids yet and her grandkids are only little for so long. After firmly telling her i wasn't interested in selling it, she offered me $20. 

I was standing in the bed of the truck looking down at her on the driveway and firmly said ""No, Carol im really not interested in selling this. Please go home."" And pointed to her side of the fence. Apparently this was shouting at her and being aggressive.  

She ran home and later in the day her husband said something to my husband as he was getting home from a game.  Telling him i (edit:"" spoke to her like a dog"" ) and was being  a ""nasty neighbor"" and that my husband needs to ""straighten me out.""  

Are my neighbors nuts? Was I that rude to her? 

(Edit I tried to attach a photo of the chair but i cant attach it on this community)

Edit : I meant no offense when I said "" old as hell"". I know that 60 is only half way through a life time.   I was trying to paint a caricature of who Carol and our other neighbors are.
