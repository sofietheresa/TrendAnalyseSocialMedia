"{""detail"":""Datei nicht gefunden""}all",Do Republicans Realize It’s Not Just Democrats - The Whole World Looks at Them with Disgust,"Republicans keep acting like this is just a culture war, as if it's about DEI, immigrants, or whatever grievance of the week gets them riled up. But what they’re enabling under Trump isn’t a debate. It’s a global threat, and the rest of the world sees it clearly.

Trump has insulted allies, threatened to abandon NATO, and pulled the U.S. out of the Paris Climate Accord again. He has imposed tariffs on Canada and Germany out of spite, joked about annexing Canada, and treated diplomacy like a reality show. These are not policies. They are provocations, and they are shaking the global order.

Now he has pulled back support for Ukraine, unraveling years of unity and leaving Europe to question whether the U.S. can still be trusted.

Republicans have already made clear they don't care how this affects people here. But they seem equally indifferent to the fact that it's dragging the rest of the world down with them. Their loyalty to Trump is wrecking alliances, stalling climate action, emboldening dictators, and unraveling decades of shared progress.

To much of the world, it looks like insanity - a country sabotaging the very systems it built, while millions cheer it on like a sport. This isn’t just short-sighted. It's a betrayal of everything we once stood for, both at home and abroad. The world is not confused. They're disgusted. And they’re right to be.

all,AITAH for refusing to pay my friend for a custom cake because it included something I’m allergic to?,"My (28F) friend (30F) is a self-taught baker who recently started her own small business. She’s made some great cakes in the past, and I wanted to support her, so I asked if she could make a cake for my mom’s 60th birthday. I told her I wanted something floral and elegant, and I gave her some examples. I also told her clearly that my mom is allergic to almonds like, epi-pen level allergic.

She agreed, and I paid her a $100 deposit for the $250 cake. A week later, I went to pick it up and she was so proud of it. It looked beautiful, honestly, but when I asked what flavor it was, she told me it was almond vanilla, because she thought it gave it a “more upscale taste.”

I was shocked. I reminded her my mom is allergic to almonds, and she just kind of brushed it off and said it was such a small amount and it would be fine as long as my mom didn’t eat too much. I told her I couldn’t take the cake, and she got upset, saying I was being overdramatic and ungrateful for all her hard work.

I told her she could either make a new cake or I wouldn’t be paying the rest. She refused, and now mutual friends are telling me I should’ve just accepted it and gotten a different dessert for my mom. Others say I was right not to risk it.

I didn’t mean to cause drama, but I’m honestly hurt that she ignored something so serious.

,,,,,,,,all,She erased us from her wedding. So I’m erasing her from mine.,"When my brother got married, his bride (now my sister-in-law) had very specific expectations. She wanted everyone in the family to wear their wedding colors, and we all did. People flew in from out of state. Everyone made an effort to make her feel celebrated.

The day before the wedding, she made some offhanded (but clearly pointed) remarks about how “our side” of the family never takes anything seriously and she wasn’t expecting us to take this seriously either. The comments made their rounds, and feelings were hurt before the wedding even began. But we still showed up, looked great, and participated.

Fast forward to getting the wedding photos and video: not a single photo of our side of the family was posted. Not one. In the entire 3-minute highlight reel? No faces from our family, except a 3-second clip of my parents with the bride and groom. The rest of us? It’s like we never existed.

I texted her (cordially) and asked if she could send me the pictures with just our siblings, since none had been posted. She responded that we never took those pictures. That’s wild because I remember helping people adjust corsages for them. She doubled down on the gaslighting. I gave it six months and asked again—she suddenly had no idea what I was talking about.

Fine.

Here’s where the petty revenge comes in.

I’m getting married in 8 days. I’ve been engaged for 6 months and planning this moment since she tried to erase us. I hired a great photographer and videographer. What she doesn’t know is that the videographer has a secret mission: make it look like she’s getting all the attention. Track her. Hover near her like she’s the star of the show. She will feel so seen.

And then… the final cut?

She won’t appear for even one second. Just like she made sure we didn’t.

I didn’t even invite her originally. Word must’ve gotten out because she cornered me at a family dinner and said, “Unfortunately I have to work the day before and after your wedding, but I should still be able to make it.” I was so stunned I just said, “That’s fine. The Airbnb is booked whether you’re there or not.” So now she’s coming. Ugh.

To cope? I spelled her name wrong on the wedding invite on purpose. That was my first move. The video blackout will be my last.

Not asking for advice. Not asking if it’s “too mean.” It’s not. It’s exactly fair.

,,,,,,,,all,"UPDATE: AITAH for telling my MIL to stop calling herself ""Mom"" to my baby?","I just want to give you an update about by situation

Original Post

I was so happy when I gave birth to my daughter four months ago. Shes my first child and honestly it's been a rollercoaster ride for me. My husband has been great but the problem started with his mom. From day one my MIL has been very involved. She visited the hospital the day after I gave birth and was constantly hovering offering advice I didn’t ask for. I chalked it up to excitement. But then things started getting weird. She began referring to herself as Mommy when holding my daughter. At first I thought I misheard. But she kept doing it. When I gently corrected her she laughed it off like I was being silly. I told my husband it made me uncomfortable and he agreed it was odd but didn’t want to confront her because according to him “that’s just how she is.""

So I did. The next time she said it, I calmly said to her that, Please don’t call yourself Mom around my daughter. It’s confusing, and frankly, it’s not your role. She looked shocked then told me I was overreacting and that babies don’t understand titles at this age. I stood firm and said, Maybe not now, but she will soon. And I’m her mom. You’re her grandma. That should be a special title too. She got upset and left early. Later that day, I got a long text about how I embarrassed her, how she was just expressing lov and how I’m being territorial and insecure. Now some of my in-laws are saying I hurt her feelings and should apologize because it’s not like she’s trying to replace me. I don’t think I’m being insecure  I just want clear. My baby will only have one mom.

So… AITAH for telling my MIL to stop calling herself “Mom” to my baby?

  
Update:

Thanks to everyone who commented  reading your responses really helped me feel more grounded. I wanted to give an update because things definitely escalated, but in some unexpected ways. So, after the confrontation and her dramatic exit, my MIL went full hurt grandma mode. She told extended family I banned her from seeing the baby (which I didn’t and that I accused her of trying to kidnap her granddaughter (???). The group texts got wild. A few flying monkeys started chiming in about how I need help and how babies don’t care what you call yourself anyway. I didn’t respond to any of it. My husband finally stepped up and called her directly. He told her she needed to respect boundaries or there would be consequences. She cried (again), said she was just trying to love the baby the way she knew how and that I was turning him against her. She posted a photo of her holding our daughter on Facebook with the caption, Mommy’s girl. Publicly. Tagging family. That was my breaking point. I immediately texted her and said, Until you can respect the fact that I am her mother  not you  we are going to take a break from visits. My husband backed me up 100%. We’ve since limited contact to just polite texts and occasional check-ins and no in-person visits for now. She hasn't apologized. So far, life has been a lot more peaceful. I’ve gotten some icy texts from a couple family members, but more surprisingly a few others reached out privately to say they had similar issues with her and respected how I handled it.

,,,,,,,,all,TIFU by trying to flirt with a guy at the gym and ending up in a full-blown CPR situation😭,"So this happened yesterday and I’m still cringing so hard I might never step into that gym again.

I (22F) recently started going to this new gym, and there’s this insanely cute guy who works out around the same time as me. I’ve been trying to find the courage to talk to him for a couple of weeks. Yesterday, I finally decided it was time.

I saw him doing deadlifts and I thought, “okay, casual compliment, easy in.” So I walked by, smiled, and said, “Your lats are majestic.” Wtf? Majestic?? What was i thinking(???) 😭😭😭
Idk why I said that. I meant to say “You’re lifting a lot” or “Nice form” or literally anything else.

He looked confused, said “uh… thanks?” and I panicked and decided to just walk away and die in the locker room.
While trying to speed-walk away in embarrassment, I tripped over a medicine ball someone left in the way, my face-planted into the floor, and I knocked the wind out of myself so hard I couldn’t breathe for like 20 seconds.
A trainer saw it happen, thought I was having a heart attack, and started actual CPR protocol before I could wheeze out “I’m fine.”

That same cute guy helped hold my legs up while I got oxygen. Pretty sure I died inside.
Anyway, now I’m the “CPR girl” at the gym. And yes, I still plan to go back (I cannot😭).

TL;DR: Tried to flirt with hot guy at the gym, said something incomprehensible, tripped, and ended up getting nearly resuscitated in front of him.😭🙏🏻

,,,,,,,,popular,AITAH for refusing to chip in for a coworker's wedding gift after literally being uninvited?,"Alright AITAH ppl, imma need your hot takes on this office drama that's been driving me insane  
  
So I (27F) have been working at this marketing agency for about 2 years. My coworker Jess (31F) is getting married next month and initially invited our whole team (8 people) to her wedding. We're not like besties besties, but definitely friendly - lunch together sometimes, happy hours, the usual work friend stuff.  
  
Last week our office manager Sarah started collecting money for a group gift. She's asking for $200 each which would get us some fancy kitchen gadget from their registry. That's basically what I'd budget for someone I'm actually friends with, but whatever, I was planning to contribute.  
  
WELL. Yesterday I got the most awkward text from Jess saying they ""had to make some cuts to the guest list"" and unfortunately they couldn't accommodate me anymore. Something about venue capacity and family additions. But here's the kicker - I KNOW FOR A FACT that everyone else on our team is still invited!!! 🙃  
  
This morning Sarah comes by my desk asking for my contribution to the gift fund. I politely told her that since I'm no longer invited, I'd rather get Jess a smaller gift on my own. Sarah looked shocked and said ""but it's a team gift"" and that not contributing the full amount would ""mess up the group harmony"" (like I give a single fuck)  
  
The icing on the cake? I know the wedding cut was because Jess invited her old coworker who just got a VP position at a major client. Suddenly there's ""no room"" for me, but I'm still expected to drop $200 on her registry?  
  
Can someone please tell me the truth if I'm the asshole for refusing to contribute the full amount to a wedding I'm not even attending?",11933.0,1532.0,2025-05-02 15:49:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1kd4bec/aitah_for_refusing_to_chip_in_for_a_coworkers/,2025-05-03 08:58:16.134905

,,,,,,,,trendingreddits,How To Guide | The Smart Blogger’s Path to a Steady Online Income,"Blogging isn’t dead—it’s evolved. What once began as an online journal has grown into a powerful tool for building authority, growing an audience, and generating sustainable income. Whether you’re a solopreneur, side hustler, or small business owner, blogging is still one of the smartest ways to earn online. But success doesn’t come overnight—it takes strategy, consistency, and knowing what works today.

In this guide, we’ll break down the path smart bloggers take to turn their writing into a steady source of income—and how you can do the same.

Why Blogging Still Works in 2025
Despite the explosion of video content and social media, blogging continues to thrive. Why? Because search engines still prioritize quality written content. People turn to Google every day with questions, and blogs that offer valuable answers continue to rise to the top.

According to a HubSpot study, businesses that blog get 55% more website visitors than those that don’t. This is especially important for American entrepreneurs looking to build authority in competitive niches.

Real-World Example: NerdWallet
NerdWallet, a personal finance company, built its multi-million-dollar brand primarily through blogging. By publishing SEO-optimized content that answered common money questions, it attracted millions of readers—and converted them into users of its affiliate partners and services.

,,,,,,,,trendingreddits,How to Prepare Americans for Upcoming Job Loss Due to AI,"As artificial intelligence (AI) continues to evolve, it’s becoming increasingly clear that its impact on the workforce will be profound. While AI promises greater efficiency, lower costs, and new industries, it also poses a significant threat to many traditional jobs—especially those involving repetitive, rule-based tasks. For Americans, the challenge ahead isn’t just technological—it’s personal, economic, and cultural.


What Jobs Are Most at Risk?
Let’s be honest — it’s the working class that’s getting hit first.
Not all jobs are equally vulnerable to AI automation. Roles that involve routine, repetitive tasks are the most at risk. So how can workers prepare for the AI-driven transformation of the labor market? Here’s a look at what’s coming, and what can be done about it. These include:

Administrative support (data entry, payroll, scheduling)

Transportation (drivers, delivery)

Retail and customer service

Basic manufacturing and warehouse jobs

Even white-collar jobs in finance, legal services, and journalism are starting to see AI encroach on tasks like report writing, contract analysis, and data interpretation.

Porcupine Tree is unquestionably one of the most difficult-to-categorize and innovative rock bands of all time. The band was formed by musician Steven Wilson in 1987, and began essentially as a solo project for Wilson, who created all of the music. By December 1993, Wilson desired to work in a band environment, and so brought on frequent collaborators. The band has been on hiatus since 2010.

Thirty minutes later, I heard yelling. Glitter everywhere. He hasn’t touched a single box since. Our packages? Arriving safely now.

,,,,,,,,all,I traveled solo to Japan to 'find myself' and ended up having this quiet moment in Kyoto that I can’t stop thinking about,"Hey everyone,  
I’ve been lurking here for a while and figured I’d finally share something from a recent trip. I just got back from three weeks in Japan, my first time traveling alone. I’m 26, recently single, and was feeling kind of stuck in life. Quit a job I hated, felt burnt out, and booked this trip hoping it would reset something in my brain.

And honestly, it did. But not in the way I expected.

Japan was incredible. I started in Tokyo, and the first night I just sat in a Lawson eating onigiri and felt like I was on another planet. It was loud and beautiful and confusing and amazing all at once. I kind of stumbled my way through the first week, but once I got used to it, I felt so free in a way I hadn’t in years.

The moment I want to share happened in Kyoto. I was trying to find this temple, Kiyomizu-dera, but my phone was on 4% and the directions were useless. I must’ve looked super lost because this older woman walking a little white dog stopped and said something to me in Japanese. I just pointed at the temple on my map and kinda shrugged.

She smiled and motioned for me to follow her. I thought she’d just point me in the right direction, but she actually walked with me the whole way. Like, 15 or 20 minutes through these quiet little side streets. We didn’t speak the same language, but it wasn’t awkward. She pointed out a few little things along the way like flowers or shrines and smiled every time I looked confused or amazed.

Her dog kept checking behind to make sure I was still there, which was somehow the cutest thing I’ve ever experienced.

When we got to the temple, I bowed and said thank you like five times. She just smiled, said something softly, and then turned around and walked back the way we came. Like it was nothing. Just helped a lost tourist without a second thought.

I don’t know. That moment has stayed with me more than any big tourist attraction. It was so simple, but so kind. I felt really seen in that moment, which was weird because we barely spoke.

Travel gives you these weird little memories that hit harder than you expect. I still think about her and her dog and that peaceful walk through Kyoto like it was a dream.

Have any of you had an experience like that? Where a stranger completely changed your day without even realizing it?",1568.0,120.0,2025-05-03 10:16:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1kdpo8b/i_traveled_solo_to_japan_to_find_myself_and_ended/,2025-05-03 11:43:36.606207
,,,,,,,,all,Update: AITAH for considering calling off my wedding because my fiancée refuses to sign a prenup after I found out she has a massive cedit card debt?,"it has been a tough few days for me after sharing my story here but I feel like I owe you guys an update about me situation so here it is

My first Post: I am just a middle aged man supposed to be getting married in a few months to my fiancée. We've been together for three years engaged for one and for most of that time I genuinely believed we were on the same page about life values and most importantly honesty. For background: I’ve worked hard to build a stable financial foundation. I’m not wealth, but I own my home outright, have no personal debt and I’ve been saving and investing since my early twenties. It’s been a priority for me especially since my parents went through a nasty divorce that ruined both of them financially. About a month ago, while we were discussing wedding costs, I brought up a prenup. Not in a cold or controlling way I just wanted to protect the life I’ve worked hard to build. I was upfront that I’d still be fair and the agreement wouldn’t leave her with nothing. I expected an adult conversation. Instead she immediately got defensive. She said things like So you’re already planning for a divorce? and I thought we trusted each other. I tried to explain it wasn’t about trust it was about transparency and mutual protection. But she shut it down completely. That’s when red flags started popping up. She became evasive every time money came up and I started noticing weird things credit card offers in the mail, a few missed payments on shared expenses she said she'd cover, and lots of I'll handle it later energy.

So, I asked directly if she had debt. She admitted it. $92,000 in credit card debt. Not student loans. Not a mortgage. Credit cards. She said it accumulated over the years from unexpected expenses and a few dumb splurges but she never told me about any of it until I forced the issue. I was stunned. We’re about to merge lives. This woman was about to legally become my spouse and she didn’t think I deserved to know she was six figures in the red? I told her this made the prenup non-negotiable for me. I need to protect myself not just emotionally, but financially. I told her I was willing to still move forward but not without something in writing that protects my premarital assets. She lost it. Called me selfish. Said I was turning love into a business deal. Said my house and money should be hers too if we’re truly a team. Since then, she’s refused to talk about the prenup again and we’re barely speaking. Even her mother called me and accused me of humiliating her daughter and being materialistic. All I want is to not be liable for debt I didn’t create and to make sure the life I built before this relationship is protected. So now I’m seriously reconsidering the whole wedding. Not because she has debt but because she hid it then refused to take responsibility and now is treating me like the bad guy for trying to protect myself. I'm almost certain that she could pay her debts since she is a part partner in her friend's business but she just refuses to. AITAH for thinking about walking away?

My final update: so I wasn’t planning to come back, but a lot of people messaged me and honestly… it’s been a hell of a few days. Figured I’d give an update. So yeah… the wedding is officially off. After I posted I tried one more time to talk to my fiancée (well, ex now). I told her I wasn’t trying to be cold or controlling I just needed to protect myself. I also said that if the roles were reversed, I’d completely understand if she wanted to do the same. I told her I could still move forward with the wedding if we signed a fair prenup. One that clearly said her debt is hers and my home/savings are mine if things go bad. I also said I’d go to therapy or counseling with her if this felt like a deeper trust issue. She didn’t take it well. Said again that the prenup was an insult and I was basically planning for divorce. Then she started crying and said I was humiliating her and that I was destroying everything we had built over money. But that’s the thing it’s not just about the money. It’s about the fact that she kept a massive amount of debt hidden until she had no choice but to tell me. And even then, she only told me because I pushed for it. That’s not partnership, that’s avoidance. So I told her I couldn’t go through with it. I called off the wedding. It sucked. It still sucks. We told the venue canceled what we could and let people know. Her family is furious. Mine has been supportive but trying not to say I told you so. I’ve lost a lot of money deposits suit some family flying in from out of state but honestly, that’s nothing compared to what could’ve happened if I had ignored my gut.

She moved out two days ago. We’ve barely spoken. I keep second-guessing myself, even now. I didn’t want this. But I also don’t want to wake up one day in financial ruin wondering why I ignored every red flag just to avoid hurting someone. Anyway, thanks for everyone who gave advice or just listened. I’m heartbroken, yeah, but I feel like I did the right thing. Doesn’t make it easy.

,,,,,,,,popular,AITAH for refusing to chip in for a coworker's wedding gift after literally being uninvited?,"Alright AITAH ppl, imma need your hot takes on this office drama that's been driving me insane

So I (27F) have been working at this marketing agency for about 2 years. My coworker Jess (31F) is getting married next month and initially invited our whole team (8 people) to her wedding. We're not like besties besties, but definitely friendly - lunch together sometimes, happy hours, the usual work friend stuff.

Last week our office manager Sarah started collecting money for a group gift. She's asking for $200 each which would get us some fancy kitchen gadget from their registry. That's basically what I'd budget for someone I'm actually friends with, but whatever, I was planning to contribute.

WELL. Yesterday I got the most awkward text from Jess saying they ""had to make some cuts to the guest list"" and unfortunately they couldn't accommodate me anymore. Something about venue capacity and family additions. But here's the kicker - I KNOW FOR A FACT that everyone else on our team is still invited!!! 🙃

This morning Sarah comes by my desk asking for my contribution to the gift fund. I politely told her that since I'm no longer invited, I'd rather get Jess a smaller gift on my own. Sarah looked shocked and said ""but it's a team gift"" and that not contributing the full amount would ""mess up the group harmony"" (like I give a single fuck)

The icing on the cake? I know the wedding cut was because Jess invited her old coworker who just got a VP position at a major client. Suddenly there's ""no room"" for me, but I'm still expected to drop $200 on her registry? The thing is that (I'm not trying to brag whatsoever), but I literally hit a 5k win on Jackpotcity like last weekend so that $200 isn't even a big deal, but what she did to me specifically is something I ain't gonna tolerate

Can someone please tell me the truth if I'm the asshole for refusing to contribute the full amount to a wedding I'm not even attending?",12699.0,1599.0,2025-05-02 15:49:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1kd4bec/aitah_for_refusing_to_chip_in_for_a_coworkers/,2025-05-03 11:43:36.606207

Thirty minutes later, I heard yelling. Glitter everywhere. He hasn’t touched a single box since. Our packages? Arriving safely now.

,,,,,,,,popular,TIFU by losing my fiance over crypto,"So, yeah, I totally screwed up big time. Me and my fiance, Jess, been together 4 years, engaged for 1. Everything was great, we was planning our wedding, picking venues and all that. But then I got sucked into crypto, specifically Solana. I thought I was gonna be some genius investor, you know?

It started when I saw some X posts about memecoins, that they are like super fast, cheap fees, blah blah. I’m not rich, but I had like 10k saved up for the wedding. I figured, why not throw 5k into those coins? Make a quick buck, surprise Jess with a fancier honeymoon. I didn’t tell her, cause I wanted it to be a surprise.

Big mistake. i lost everything in the first few weeks. My 10k was gone. I was freaking out, couldn’t sleep. Jess noticed I was acting weird, kept asking what’s wrong. I didn’t wanna tell her I blew our wedding fund, so I lied, said it was work stress.

She found out anyway. I left my laptop open, and she saw the trading app, the red numbers, the whole mess. She flipped out, screaming how I gambled our future without even telling her.

Though in some years, I will earn well though. And I barely get time for going to parlour etc. As I just want to rest on Sundays. Note I am very well maintained girl and like to keep myself groomed, stylish. My bf 28m is civil engineer.

He was at my place and we got cosy. I am not super hairy, but had some hair down there. After we had fun, he told me he got disgusted by hair down there and why  am i not mainting my hygiene? Note I keep myself super clean and before we got cosy. I took bath and applied lotions. I asked did he smell something? He said those hair looks bad and he likes me smooth.

I got irritated and said his nose hair need to be trimmed,  because they look so big and I felt disgusted to kiss him, when they touched my lips. I told him he hasn't trimmed his chest hair in whole. They are touching his neck .

He got offended and isn't talking to me. But I won't apologise. He said i didn't smell bad. Then i told him he is super hairy and he should be mature enough to understand that I am not a p**n star to be hairless all the time.  Did i take it too far? Though this morning he has trimmed it all lmao. 

Though I like chest hair when they are not coming out of your shirt buttons.

,,,,,,,,popular,AITA for refusing to travel with my brother’s family because his kids only eat junk food?,"I (M39) am currently undergoing cancer treatment. In the end of it all, I am planning to take a holiday with a friend or family member to travel to the other side of the world. I am based in the UK and I am thinking Vietnam, South Korea, Japan or somewhere around there where I have never been. 

I asked my brother (M43) if he would consider coming with me. He got very excited and said his daughter (F12) and son (M8) would also come along. They are both incredibly picky eaters, and my niece only eats plain beige foods. She won’t even have a burger at McDonalds, just chips and nuggets, and that’s pretty much 80% of the kids’ diet. I know my brother and his wife have tried hard to introduce them to other foods, but they just wont eat it. I love the two kids to bits, I really do. 

However, I want to travel to experience the food culture and that is a major part of it for me. I want to get off the beaten path and experience things in life I haven’t been brave enough to experience before. For me, selfishly, this trip is about the end of my cancer and celebrating that there is life after cancer. It’s also not something I can easily afford. 

This is where I might be the asshole. I asked my brother to come travel with me, and when he said his kids would come too, I told him I would rather travel with someone else. He is disappointed and angry with me, and frustrated that I don’t want to travel with his family. He feels I am being selfish as travelling with his children can also be fulfilling. I would also like to spend time with them and do some child friendly things during the holiday. 

He had already gotten my niece and nephew excited about the travel too. To make things worse, we live in different countries so we don’t see each other a lot. They will be very disappointed when they learn I have pulled the plug on the plans. I feel conflicted.

,,,,,,,,all,AITAH for refusing to give my boyfriend children because he won’t marry me,"My boyfriend (33m) and I (31f) have been dating for seven years. Early on we talked about marriage, kids, a house, the whole shebang. 

I like kids and I think I’d be a good mother. I’d like to have children but I wouldn’t be upset if I didn’t have any. I’m happy with my life as is, and I could be happy with children as well. My boyfriend has always dreamed of being a dad, and recently suggested that we’re in the  place to start trying for some.  

I was a little confused by this. I told him early on, within the first year, that I would never have children with a man that I’m not married to. I feel like children are a much bigger commitment than marriage, so marriage should come first. Additionally, if a man doesn’t love me and isn’t committed enough to spending the rest of our lives together, I don’t see why I wouldn’t make the sacrifice of bearing his children? Maybe it’s old fashioned of me. I explained all of this to him, once again. 

He was awkward, and said he just doesn’t want to get married. He said men get screwed over in divorces all the time, and he just doesn’t think marriage is important or a smart choice. 

I said that’s fine. We don’t have to get married. I’m happy with our life as is. We just won’t be buying a house together or having children together. We can each buy our own house and live in one, and rent out the other. If we aren’t getting married I don’t want to really entangle our finances in any way. 

He blew up at me and said I’m punishing him for not waiting to marry him. I said I’m not, just that having children outside of marriage goes outside of my personal values. 

I also told him that since he’s super against the idea of marriage I am not going to marry him just for a shut up ring, that he only gives me because he wants kids. I want him to actually want to marry me, and if not, that’s okay. Children and marriage are off the table for us. If he wants kids now he needs to leave me and find someone who will have kids for him without expecting any stability in return. And maybe I could find someone who wants to marry me, and maybe or maybe not have kids. I said all of this to him. 

He’s been very distressed and emotionally distraught. He has a disease that very much so limits his life expectancy. He has said that if he doesn’t have kids asap he probably shouldn’t have them at all, because otherwise he wouldn’t be able to see them into adulthood.

,,,,,,,,popular,She erased us from her wedding. So I’m erasing her from mine.,"When my brother got married, his bride (now my sister-in-law) had very specific expectations. She wanted everyone in the family to wear their wedding colors, and we all did. People flew in from out of state. Everyone made an effort to make her feel celebrated.

The day before the wedding, she made some offhanded (but clearly pointed) remarks about how “our side” of the family never takes anything seriously and she wasn’t expecting us to take this seriously either. The comments made their rounds, and feelings were hurt before the wedding even began. But we still showed up, looked great, and participated.

Fast forward to getting the wedding photos and video: not a single photo of our side of the family was posted. Not one. In the entire 3-minute highlight reel? No faces from our family, except a 3-second clip of my parents with the bride and groom. The rest of us? It’s like we never existed.

I texted her (cordially) and asked if she could send me the pictures with just our siblings, since none had been posted. She responded that we never took those pictures. That’s wild because I remember helping people adjust corsages for them. She doubled down on the gaslighting. I gave it six months and asked again—she suddenly had no idea what I was talking about.

Fine.

Here’s where the petty revenge comes in.

I’m getting married in 8 days. I’ve been engaged for 6 months and planning this moment since she tried to erase us. I hired a great photographer and videographer. What she doesn’t know is that the videographer has a secret mission: make it look like she’s getting all the attention. Track her. Hover near her like she’s the star of the show. She will feel so seen.

And then… the final cut?

She won’t appear for even one second. Just like she made sure we didn’t.

I didn’t even invite her originally. Word must’ve gotten out because she cornered me at a family dinner and said, “Unfortunately I have to work the day before and after your wedding, but I should still be able to make it.” I was so stunned I just said, “That’s fine. The Airbnb is booked whether you’re there or not.” So now she’s coming. Ugh.

To cope? I spelled her name wrong on the wedding invite on purpose. That was my first move. The video blackout will be my last.

Not asking for advice. Not asking if it’s “too mean.” It’s not. It’s exactly fair.

,,,,,,,,popular,Update: AITAH for considering calling off my wedding because my fiancée refuses to sign a prenup after I found out she has a massive cedit card debt?,"it has been a tough few days for me after sharing my story here but I feel like I owe you guys an update about me situation so here it is

My first Post: I am just a middle aged man supposed to be getting married in a few months to my fiancée. We've been together for three years engaged for one and for most of that time I genuinely believed we were on the same page about life values and most importantly honesty. For background: I’ve worked hard to build a stable financial foundation. I’m not wealth, but I own my home outright, have no personal debt and I’ve been saving and investing since my early twenties. It’s been a priority for me especially since my parents went through a nasty divorce that ruined both of them financially. About a month ago, while we were discussing wedding costs, I brought up a prenup. Not in a cold or controlling way I just wanted to protect the life I’ve worked hard to build. I was upfront that I’d still be fair and the agreement wouldn’t leave her with nothing. I expected an adult conversation. Instead she immediately got defensive. She said things like So you’re already planning for a divorce? and I thought we trusted each other. I tried to explain it wasn’t about trust it was about transparency and mutual protection. But she shut it down completely. That’s when red flags started popping up. She became evasive every time money came up and I started noticing weird things credit card offers in the mail, a few missed payments on shared expenses she said she'd cover, and lots of I'll handle it later energy.

So, I asked directly if she had debt. She admitted it. $92,000 in credit card debt. Not student loans. Not a mortgage. Credit cards. She said it accumulated over the years from unexpected expenses and a few dumb splurges but she never told me about any of it until I forced the issue. I was stunned. We’re about to merge lives. This woman was about to legally become my spouse and she didn’t think I deserved to know she was six figures in the red? I told her this made the prenup non-negotiable for me. I need to protect myself not just emotionally, but financially. I told her I was willing to still move forward but not without something in writing that protects my premarital assets. She lost it. Called me selfish. Said I was turning love into a business deal. Said my house and money should be hers too if we’re truly a team. Since then, she’s refused to talk about the prenup again and we’re barely speaking. Even her mother called me and accused me of humiliating her daughter and being materialistic. All I want is to not be liable for debt I didn’t create and to make sure the life I built before this relationship is protected. So now I’m seriously reconsidering the whole wedding. Not because she has debt but because she hid it then refused to take responsibility and now is treating me like the bad guy for trying to protect myself. I'm almost certain that she could pay her debts since she is a part partner in her friend's business but she just refuses to. AITAH for thinking about walking away?

My final update: so I wasn’t planning to come back, but a lot of people messaged me and honestly… it’s been a hell of a few days. Figured I’d give an update. So yeah… the wedding is officially off. After I posted I tried one more time to talk to my fiancée (well, ex now). I told her I wasn’t trying to be cold or controlling I just needed to protect myself. I also said that if the roles were reversed, I’d completely understand if she wanted to do the same. I told her I could still move forward with the wedding if we signed a fair prenup. One that clearly said her debt is hers and my home/savings are mine if things go bad. I also said I’d go to therapy or counseling with her if this felt like a deeper trust issue. She didn’t take it well. Said again that the prenup was an insult and I was basically planning for divorce. Then she started crying and said I was humiliating her and that I was destroying everything we had built over money. But that’s the thing it’s not just about the money. It’s about the fact that she kept a massive amount of debt hidden until she had no choice but to tell me. And even then, she only told me because I pushed for it. That’s not partnership, that’s avoidance. So I told her I couldn’t go through with it. I called off the wedding. It sucked. It still sucks. We told the venue canceled what we could and let people know. Her family is furious. Mine has been supportive but trying not to say I told you so. I’ve lost a lot of money deposits suit some family flying in from out of state but honestly, that’s nothing compared to what could’ve happened if I had ignored my gut.

She moved out two days ago. We’ve barely spoken. I keep second-guessing myself, even now. I didn’t want this. But I also don’t want to wake up one day in financial ruin wondering why I ignored every red flag just to avoid hurting someone. Anyway, thanks for everyone who gave advice or just listened. I’m heartbroken, yeah, but I feel like I did the right thing. Doesn’t make it easy. Just necessary.",14127.0,2258.0,2025-05-03 09:45:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1kdp8fb/update_aitah_for_considering_calling_off_my/,2025-05-03 21:50:47.095145
,,,,,,,,popular,AITA for refusing to travel with my brother’s family because his kids only eat junk food?,"I (M39) am currently undergoing cancer treatment. In the end of it all, I am planning to take a holiday with a friend or family member to travel to the other side of the world. I am based in the UK and I am thinking Vietnam, South Korea, Japan or somewhere around there where I have never been. 

I asked my brother (M43) if he would consider coming with me. He got very excited and said his daughter (F12) and son (M8) would also come along. They are both incredibly picky eaters, and my niece only eats plain beige foods. She won’t even have a burger at McDonalds, just chips and nuggets, and that’s pretty much 80% of the kids’ diet. I know my brother and his wife have tried hard to introduce them to other foods, but they just wont eat it. I love the two kids to bits, I really do. 

However, I want to travel to experience the food culture and that is a major part of it for me. I want to get off the beaten path and experience things in life I haven’t been brave enough to experience before. For me, selfishly, this trip is about the end of my cancer and celebrating that there is life after cancer. It’s also not something I can easily afford. 

This is where I might be the asshole. I asked my brother to come travel with me, and when he said his kids would come too, I told him I would rather travel with someone else. He is disappointed and angry with me, and frustrated that I don’t want to travel with his family. He feels I am being selfish as travelling with his children can also be fulfilling. I would also like to spend time with them and do some child friendly things during the holiday. 

He had already gotten my niece and nephew excited about the travel too. To make things worse, we live in different countries so we don’t see each other a lot. They will be very disappointed when they learn I have pulled the plug on the plans. I feel conflicted.

So, AITA? ",4514.0,1093.0,2025-05-03 12:22:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1kdrpp6/aita_for_refusing_to_travel_with_my_brothers/,2025-05-03 21:50:47.095145
,,,,,,,,popular,I just nuked all my design assets after my old agency stole years of my work,"About 5 years ago I worked as a graphic designer for a boutique marketing agency. They paid me barely above minimum wage despite charging clients premium rates for my work. I was fresh out of school, desperate for experience, and they knew it. I created hundreds of custom illustrations, logos, branding packages, and social media templates. I regularly worked 60+ hour weeks with no overtime. My portfolio grew impressive but my bank account didn't reflect it.

The toxic workplace was next level. The creative director would criticize work in front of clients to make herself look more valuable. Account managers would promise impossible timelines without consulting me, then blame me when deadlines were missed. After a year, I gathered my courage and asked for a raise, showing them how my designs had directly increased client retention and brought in referral business. They agreed I was ""valuable"" but said raises weren't in the budget. The next week, the owner bought a Tesla.

I quit two days later with no backup plan. It took months to find stable work, but I eventually landed at a company that respects my time and pays fairly. Yesterday, I discovered they were still using a portfolio site I had designed AND maintained under my personal domain. They never paid for these rights. Even worse, they were passing off newer designers' work as mine to leverage my reputation with former clients.

So I took screenshots as evidence, downloaded everything for my records, and deleted the entire site. I also changed all passwords and revoked their access to the premium font libraries I'd purchased with my own money. They're going to wake up to broken links, missing assets, and a lot of explaining to do to their clients.

,,,,,,,,popular,Tomboys are a thing. Tired of being asked my sexuality or having it assumed just because of what I wear,"I'm a tomboy. No more , no less. I'm NOT gay. Or bi. Or queer. Or gender fluid . Or ""butch"" or whatever cute/catchy little buzzword is trending today. And I'm tired of being asked it every time I wear a t-shirt and jeans. I'm JUST a fucking tomboy. I wear what I want, WHEN I want. I WILL be comfortable. And clothes can't fuck. So they shouldn't give anyone any ideas of what I might be down for. But that's something that's been argued for a while even in the LGBTQ community. I've even heard people say that the term is offensive. Since when did that term become derogatory? Or 'offensive'? To WHO? I guess i understand since literally everything is ""offensive"" nowadays. 

I also hate that there don't seem to be anymore tomboy characters in tv/movies anymore, they just make them lesbian. Which is fine sometimes bc that absolutely needs representation too, but sometimes it comes across as lazy writing in my opinion. I feel like that could send the wrong message to kids in kids movies/tv; that every single girl that wears jeans instead of dresses is gay. Sure some might be and that's great. But what about tomboys? I guess I just wanna know what happened to the ""in between""? lol. It seems to be very either or nowadays. Rant over.

,,,,,,,,popular,Carney’s salary cut to become PM,"I’ll be honest.. I didn’t vote for Carney. I had my doubts because of the last 2 liberal terms. On top of that, the whole “global elite banker turned politician” narrative didn’t give me the greatest impression. I wasn’t convinced he would try to help regular hard working Canadians.

Watching his press conference yesterday made me see a different side to him. I was shocked that he was clear and straight to the point. 

From a finance perspective, it dawned on me that he probably took a massive pay cut to become PM. Based on my quick google search, a PM’s salary is around C$400K, which is definitely a lot, but for someone with Carney’s background and experience, he could be making way more in the private sector with far less stress and without taking up the responsibility of leading an entire country.

Makes me think his motivation is more about service  because I know many wouldn’t walk away from the $$ potential or job opportunities he has. I’m not saying I’m suddenly a diehard fan but it’s making me rethink my stance on him.",1844.0,777.0,2025-05-03 13:45:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadaFinance/comments/1kdtby7/carneys_salary_cut_to_become_pm/,2025-05-03 21:50:47.095145
,,,,,,,,popular,Stop under leveling yourself in the remaster,"I see alot of players min maxing, attempting to only use 2/3 skills to keep their character from ""overleveling"" 

This was only a viable strategy in og oblivion because the leveling system made it hard to achieve a perfect level up when using multiple skills. In og oblivion you could easily mess a build up by leveling at the wrong time and only getting a +3 to your main attributes.  

The remaster fixed this and gives you 12 attribute points to spend how you please on every level up regardless of what skills you used to get to that level. 

There's no reason you should still be level 3 and trying to save bruma from a seige. 

Unless you're making a role play build with minimal combat skills avoiding leveling is just depriving your character of better loot for no real reason.

,,,,,,,,trendingreddits,How To Guide | The Smart Blogger’s Path to a Steady Online Income,"Blogging isn’t dead—it’s evolved. What once began as an online journal has grown into a powerful tool for building authority, growing an audience, and generating sustainable income. Whether you’re a solopreneur, side hustler, or small business owner, blogging is still one of the smartest ways to earn online. But success doesn’t come overnight—it takes strategy, consistency, and knowing what works today.

In this guide, we’ll break down the path smart bloggers take to turn their writing into a steady source of income—and how you can do the same.

Why Blogging Still Works in 2025
Despite the explosion of video content and social media, blogging continues to thrive. Why? Because search engines still prioritize quality written content. People turn to Google every day with questions, and blogs that offer valuable answers continue to rise to the top.

According to a HubSpot study, businesses that blog get 55% more website visitors than those that don’t. This is especially important for American entrepreneurs looking to build authority in competitive niches.

Real-World Example: NerdWallet
NerdWallet, a personal finance company, built its multi-million-dollar brand primarily through blogging. By publishing SEO-optimized content that answered common money questions, it attracted millions of readers—and converted them into users of its affiliate partners and services.

,,,,,,,,trendingreddits,How to Prepare Americans for Upcoming Job Loss Due to AI,"As artificial intelligence (AI) continues to evolve, it’s becoming increasingly clear that its impact on the workforce will be profound. While AI promises greater efficiency, lower costs, and new industries, it also poses a significant threat to many traditional jobs—especially those involving repetitive, rule-based tasks. For Americans, the challenge ahead isn’t just technological—it’s personal, economic, and cultural.


What Jobs Are Most at Risk?
Let’s be honest — it’s the working class that’s getting hit first.
Not all jobs are equally vulnerable to AI automation. Roles that involve routine, repetitive tasks are the most at risk. So how can workers prepare for the AI-driven transformation of the labor market? Here’s a look at what’s coming, and what can be done about it. These include:

Administrative support (data entry, payroll, scheduling)

Transportation (drivers, delivery)

Retail and customer service

Basic manufacturing and warehouse jobs

Even white-collar jobs in finance, legal services, and journalism are starting to see AI encroach on tasks like report writing, contract analysis, and data interpretation.

A community for 13 years, 29,937 subscribers.
 
Welcome to the subreddit of the poet laureate of rock 'n' roll.

The voice of the promise of the '60s counter-culture. The guy who forced folk into bed with rock. Who donned make-up in the '70s and disappeared into a haze of substance abuse. Who emerged to find Jesus. Who was written off as a has-been by the end of the '80s and who suddenly shifted gears, releasing some of the strongest music of his career beginning in the late '90s.

Ladies and gentlemen — Columbia recording artist Bob Dylan!

You know in games or movies when you find a odd little secret that someone in production left unnoticed for the few in the audience that would look for it or happen to stumble upon it?  This is the place to share those things you find in real life. 

This isn’t the area for posting digital Easter eggs, as in screenshots or photographs of screens (games, computer software, TV series, DVD menus); as those are regular Easter eggs and not IRL Easter eggs. Try /r/EasterEggs for such things.

,,,,,,,,all,"Whistleblowing in Federal IT: What I Did, Why It Matters, and How You Can Speak Up Safely","Hi FedNews, 

I’m a federal IT specialist who, about two weeks ago, filed a formal disclosure with Congress about a potential major security incident inside my agency and asked for an investigation. 
I’m posting to remind every public servant that speaking up matters and you’re not alone. You should feel empowered. Transparency is key.

What happened at a high level.
* Noticed some odd metrics
* Gathered data and built reports
* Reported internally 
* Escalated chain of command
* Disclosed to Congress

(NPR and KrebsOnSecurity have the full timeline and more details. Also, the disclosure is public. https://whistlebloweraid.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025_0414_Berulis-Disclosure-with-Exhibits.s.pdf )


As to why I spoke up when internal reporting failed…

I loved my job, my team, my agency, our mission, and the opportunity to serve the people of this great nation. When internal channels stalled, I weighed my clearance, paycheck, and career against the potential national impact of staying silent. The country’s cybersecurity, and the public’s trust, were worth the risk. If fear mutes us, we fail our oath. Fear and apathy are the death of democracy.


Lessons learned..

1) Document everything. Conversations, metrics, screenshots, ticket numbers, timestamps. Use only work devices; keep classified data classified.


2) Use protected channels first. IG hotlines, CISA US-CERT, or cleared counsel. Escalate only if stonewalled or compromised.


3) Know your rights. 5 U.S.C. § 7211 guarantees a direct path to Congress. Invoke it precisely.


4) Build a support net early. Line up legal help, trusted colleagues, and friends/family to keep you grounded.


5) Take safety seriously. Check your car, install cameras/alarms, vary routines, lock down your digital life. They seem dramatic,  until they aren't.


6) Guard your mental health. Stress is real; therapy, exercise, or simply talking helps.


I chose to attach my name because I stand behind my actions and welcome open debate. You don’t have to; there are secure, anonymous avenues.


Closing thought

Each of us entered public service to uphold the Constitution and serve millions who may never know our names. That duty runs deeper than politics or fear. We all know the difference between right and wrong. If something at your agency keeps you up at night, don’t hope the storm passes and keep your head down. Gather the facts, protect yourself, and speak up. Duty is hardest when it matters most, which is exactly why it matters most.

- Dan

,,,,,,,,all,My mortgage is completely paid off!,"Yesterday was my last mortgage payment (and it was just a fraction of what I paid every week--$90 instead of $450). I (55 3/4 F) bought the house on my own in 2008. I paid the mortgage every week long before I got married, then as the primary/only breadwinner afterwards. And I'm both proud & relieved to be done.

Here's where the old person yelling comes in. Television trained me to believe that there would be some kind of document that I could burn to mark the milestone. There isn't (yet? Maybe I'll get some kind of doc from the bank in the mail?).

Instead, as I do all my banking online, and the payment comes out at the end of the day, I had to look at that $90 balance for days and days. Then this morning, I logged in hoping to see the account balance at zero. My plan was to screenshot it and send it to those in my life who'd celebrate with me, virtually. 

And yet... log in and the account was gone! Not zero, but disappeared. I'm happy it's gone, but I feel shafted on the celebratory experience. Any other GenXers let down by hitting this milestone without anything to bote it?

,,,,,,,,popular,Anybody else suddenly surrounded by people OUR AGE diagnosed with cancer?,"In the last year, *five* of my close millennial friends have been diagnosed with cancer. All of them have healthy lifestyles.

One’s a medal-winning marathon runner: age 42, breast cancer, stage I. Another: age 39, cervical cancer, stage I. Another: age 42, rectal cancer, stage II. Another: age 37, stomach cancer, stage III. The worst: age 43, stage IVa, highly lethal, highly aggressive liver cancer that just came out of the blue. 

We expect our parents/grandparents to get cancer. But late 30s - early 40s just feels WAY too young.

I’m scared and sad for my friends. I’m also not immune to the anxiety that every little pain means it’s my turn next.

Stop calling them maga.  They are Russians influencers.


You people are so obsessed with your conspiracy theories you will do anything in your power to avoid actual research and see you’re parroting Russian bullshit . If you even just looked deeper into where the theories you believe are coming from you would realize it's not anywhere near as trustworthy as you think. Like if you actually looked at how hateful you’ve become.  How unAmerican you are.

 And you'd see all the cult tactics being used on you.  1) make you mistrust media.   You’ll only get correct information from one source.  2). Isolate you.  3). Give you a mission.  Something that’ll make you lose your identity. “save the babies”.  4) Give you an enemy to focus on.  “Dems, left, libs?   5).  “Save the babies.  Save the babies.” Or whatever motto is used over and over and over.   6). Give you a savior and he is the only person that can solve it.   
It’s common brainwashing and cult tactics. Everyone knows this but you. 

You’re being used.  And it will one day turn on you. 

But no, you'd never do that, because that's less fun and less hateful. And you'll still act super smug about it like you know something everyone else doesn't but really you're just super ignorant and brainwashed and proud of it.  

You  believe this shit cause you want to.  

Jesus was about mutual love 
Your movement is about mutual hate
You’re in a hate group.  Wake the fuck up
They want you asleep   Not woke.  So they can brainwash you.  

You are no longer Americans.  You are Russian influencers. 

You want to burn this country to the ground just so you can rule over the ashes.

Smh  CHRISTIAN NATIONALISM IS THE KKK WITHOUT THE HOOD AND ROBE. 

There is nothing Christian about your movement.   Facts!

,,,,,,,,all,My cousin named her daughter ‘Siobhan’ but insists it’s pronounced ‘See-oh-banny’,"I try really hard to keep my mouth shut when it comes to baby names, especially with my family, because everyone’s got feelings and you can’t say a damn thing without it becoming a generational feud. But this one… this one broke me.

My cousin (born and raised in suburban Texas, hasn’t left the country except for one all inclusive in Cancun) recently had a baby girl. She proudly announced at the baby shower that they’d chosen an “authentic Irish name” because she “just loves the vibe of Celtic stuff” (her words, not mine). The name? Siobhan. What is an Irish name? Yes. [That my cousin spends all day hooked on this? Also, 100%. Some inspiration would come from both things.](https://aitah.click/obprrh)

Okay, cool. Classic name. Beautiful, if you say it right.

But then she said it out loud: “See-oh-banny.”

I blinked. I thought maybe she was joking. I said, gently, “Oh, you mean Shiv-awn, right?” She looked at me like I had insulted her child’s soul. “No. It’s See-oh-banny. That’s how we say it.”

I tried to explain that Irish spelling doesn’t work the same as English phonetics, that names like Siobhan or Niamh or Aoife look confusing but have established pronunciations. She just doubled down. “Well, I think it’s more beautiful our way. We’re making it our own.”

She then went on a small rant about how the name should evolve “with the culture” and how America has “its own version of Irish now.” I’m still not sure what that means. I tried one more time, just for the child’s future sanity. “You know, Siobhan is pronounced Shiv-awn in Ireland, so maybe she’ll want to know that when she’s older”

She cut me off. “Well, this is America. And in America, it’s See-oh-banny.”

So now there’s a baby out there named “See-oh-banny,” who will one day be very confused when she tries to buy a keychain in Dublin.",2653.0,394.0,2025-05-03 23:25:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/tragedeigh/comments/1ke62rt/my_cousin_named_her_daughter_siobhan_but_insists/,2025-05-04 03:05:46.638574

,,,,,,,,popular,AITA for refusing to travel with my brother’s family because his kids only eat junk food?,"I (M39) am currently undergoing cancer treatment. In the end of it all, I am planning to take a holiday with a friend or family member to travel to the other side of the world. I am based in the UK and I am thinking Vietnam, South Korea, Japan or somewhere around there where I have never been. 

I asked my brother (M43) if he would consider coming with me. He got very excited and said his daughter (F12) and son (M8) would also come along. They are both incredibly picky eaters, and my niece only eats plain beige foods. She won’t even have a burger at McDonalds, just chips and nuggets, and that’s pretty much 80% of the kids’ diet. I know my brother and his wife have tried hard to introduce them to other foods, but they just wont eat it. I love the two kids to bits, I really do. 

However, I want to travel to experience the food culture and that is a major part of it for me. I want to get off the beaten path and experience things in life I haven’t been brave enough to experience before. For me, selfishly, this trip is about the end of my cancer and celebrating that there is life after cancer. It’s also not something I can easily afford. 

This is where I might be the asshole. I asked my brother to come travel with me, and when he said his kids would come too, I told him I would rather travel with someone else. He is disappointed and angry with me, and frustrated that I don’t want to travel with his family. He feels I am being selfish as travelling with his children can also be fulfilling. I would also like to spend time with them and do some child friendly things during the holiday. 

He had already gotten my niece and nephew excited about the travel too. To make things worse, we live in different countries so we don’t see each other a lot. They will be very disappointed when they learn I have pulled the plug on the plans. I feel conflicted.

So, AITA? 

ETA: I am currently having cancer treatment. I only just started. I have grade 3, stage 3 thyroid cancer that is spread to cervical spine. I have chemo now, started first round, and then surgery, then more chemo and then radio. The travel won’t be until late 2026 at the earliest (god willing).
ETA: the travel will be 2 weeks
ETA: it’s not a holiday to a tourist destination, I look to go off the beaten path. ",6316.0,1399.0,2025-05-03 12:22:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1kdrpp6/aita_for_refusing_to_travel_with_my_brothers/,2025-05-04 03:05:46.638574

,,,,,,,,popular,People driving around Ontario with “F Carney” flags - why?!,"I’m hoping to get some genuine insight from anybody that has made the expedient brand pivot. I have my own theories and understanding of why but I’m hoping to hear supporters of the idea articulate it.

While I never agreed with the “F Trudeau” flags, I could better understand why people did it. From the moment he took office, he made a certain ideology his brand and part of his leading and legislating. I get the perception that he made statements that felt like attacks to some, i can see how you’d interpret some of his choices as “forced” DEI more than any other leader in Canadian history has ever done. Then covid hit and he took more on the chin than anybody, especially when it came to provincial mandates.

I don’t get the Carney hate though. I can see not liking him, sure. I can see a particular party allegiance. But he’s a stoic, pragmatic, economic leader. *He’s what conservatives drool over*. He’s barely had any time to make any changes, and the changes he has made should be seen as positives to anybody that hated Trudeau before him. He made a large, thoughtful and very elaborate policy platform and made stronger efforts to address Canadians largest complaints more than anybody and it certainly seems like it’s more than just talk.

So… why? Don’t you think the immediate pivot from *Trudeau is evil* to *Carney is evil* kind of delegitimizes ten years of effort against a certain populist? Don’t you think people are going to take you even less serious now?

I’ll speak honestly, I was embarrassed by the “F Trudeau” flags and stickers, but I lived with them. From the perspective of a normie (somewhat at least?) this “F Carney” stuff is just embarrassing Americanized garbage and maybe if you don’t have a reasonable answer for the immediate pivot, it’s time to consider a little reflection?

,,,,,,,,popular,AITAH for refusing to give my boyfriend children because he won’t marry me,"My boyfriend (33m) and I (31f) have been dating for seven years. Early on we talked about marriage, kids, a house, the whole shebang. 

I like kids and I think I’d be a good mother. I’d like to have children but I wouldn’t be upset if I didn’t have any. I’m happy with my life as is, and I could be happy with children as well. My boyfriend has always dreamed of being a dad, and recently suggested that we’re in the  place to start trying for some.  

I was a little confused by this. I told him early on, within the first year, that I would never have children with a man that I’m not married to. I feel like children are a much bigger commitment than marriage, so marriage should come first. Additionally, if a man doesn’t love me and isn’t committed enough to spending the rest of our lives together, I don’t see why I wouldn’t make the sacrifice of bearing his children? Maybe it’s old fashioned of me. I explained all of this to him, once again. 

He was awkward, and said he just doesn’t want to get married. He said men get screwed over in divorces all the time, and he just doesn’t think marriage is important or a smart choice. 

I said that’s fine. We don’t have to get married. I’m happy with our life as is. We just won’t be buying a house together or having children together. We can each buy our own house and live in one, and rent out the other. If we aren’t getting married I don’t want to really entangle our finances in any way. 

He blew up at me and said I’m punishing him for not waiting to marry him. I said I’m not, just that having children outside of marriage goes outside of my personal values. 

I also told him that since he’s super against the idea of marriage I am not going to marry him just for a shut up ring, that he only gives me because he wants kids. I want him to actually want to marry me, and if not, that’s okay. Children and marriage are off the table for us. If he wants kids now he needs to leave me and find someone who will have kids for him without expecting any stability in return. And maybe I could find someone who wants to marry me, and maybe or maybe not have kids. I said all of this to him. 

He’s been very distressed and emotionally distraught. He has a disease that very much so limits his life expectancy. He has said that if he doesn’t have kids asap he probably shouldn’t have them at all, because otherwise he wouldn’t be able to see them into adulthood.

I found a parking spot on the bottom floor of the garage that is all the way in the corner. It's dark there and quite well hidden.

,,,,,,,,all,AITAH for not selling my neighbor a thrifted rocking chair I JUST BOUGHT?,"I honestly have no words.  I (27)  just bought my house in july 2024.  We have learned that most of the neighbors are all old as hell.( i think these neighbors are 60s +) and are very nosey and onery that young families are moving into the neighborhood in recent years. They will just walk up to you and tell you this. 

I have been shopping thrift and estate sales to furnish this cute house. This morning, I came home from an estate sale with a BEAUTIFUL wingbacked rocking chair. (It needs to be reuplostered as the leather that was on it is in terrible condition and the previous owner started pulling it off. ) 

Im unloading it from the bed of my truck when neighbor , Carol,  sticks her giraffe neck over the fence and starts squawking about how beautiful it is . I said thanks i got it at an estate sale for $10! This triggered the parasites in her brain and she, i shit you not, teleported over to the truck. She starts going off about how much she needs a chair to rock her grandkids to sleep in and how much she would appreciate it if it was hers. I told her I got it for my future babies to be rocked to sleep in and that it still  needs lots of work before it can be used. Mind you this chair is large and she is very small. 

This is when she starts offering me money ($15 because "" its more than what you paid for it"") then telling me i dont need it because i dont have kids yet and her grandkids are only little for so long. After firmly telling her i wasn't interested in selling it, she offered me $20. 

I was standing in the bed of the truck looking down at her on the driveway and firmly said ""No, Carol im really not interested in selling this. Please go home."" And pointed to her side of the fence. Apparently this was shouting at her and being aggressive.  

She ran home and later in the day her husband said something to my husband as he was getting home from a game.  Telling him i (edit:"" spoke to her like a dog"" ) and was being  a ""nasty neighbor"" and that my husband needs to ""straighten me out.""  

Are my neighbors nuts? Was I that rude to her? Also, if perhaps their house accidentally burns down, it for sure wasnt me. 

(Edit I tried to attach a photo of the chair but i cant attach it on this community)

Edit : I meant no offense when I said "" old as hell"". I know that 60 is barely half way through a life time.   I was trying to paint a caricature of who Carol and our other neighbors are. There is something really wrong with the folks in the cul-de-sac.

,,,,,,,,popular,"AITA for divorcing my wife and not wanting to give her half after she said I ""wasted her time""?","I (32M) have been married to my wife (28F) for six years. We met when she was 21, I was 25. We dated for about a year before getting married. Things were good for a long time, but in the past two years, I started realizing we’d grown into very different people. We want different things, have different priorities, and to be completely honest  the love I felt for her has slowly faded. I didn't cheat, I didn't lie  I just fell out of love.

I tried to communicate. We did therapy. I gave it time. But eventually, I came to the conclusion that staying married would just be delaying the inevitable, and it wouldn’t be fair to either of us. So I told her I wanted a divorce.

She was understandably upset, but then things escalated. She said I ""wasted her time"" and that I ""used up her good years"" only to leave her. She now wants half of everything  the house, my retirement account, investments  even though she didn’t contribute much financially (she’s been in and out of work, and I’ve been the primary earner for most of the marriage).

We signed a prenuptial agreement before we got married. It was fair she had her own lawyer, there was no pressure, and it clearly laid out what would happen if we ever split. It protects the assets I brought into the marriage, and it doesn’t entitle either of us to spousal support unless certain conditions are met (which aren’t).

Now she’s saying the prenup shouldn't matter, because I ""emotionally conned"" her into a dead-end marriage and wasted her youth. That even though it’s legally binding, morally I should give her half because I “took her best years and gave nothing back.”

I don’t see it that way. I loved her when we married. I was faithful. I supported her emotionally and financially. I tried everything to make it work. Falling out of love isn’t a crime and I don’t think I should be punished for something I didn’t do maliciously.

 AITA for sticking to the prenup and not giving her half just because she says I wasted her time?

,,,,,,,,popular,Coworker found me on a dating app and won't let it go. What do I do?,"I am a female that works in a primarily male dominated field. I truly love my job, it's probably the best one I've had by far. Here's the coworker issue: one of my coworkers found me on a dating app. Well, he said his brother found me and asked him if he worked with me, due to my specification of the industry I worked in/my location. I wasn't working the day he made this discovery. Upon finding out I was on said dating app, he made it a point to let EVERYONE know I was. I found it odd. Why should he or anyone else care? I then realized it was in a ""damn she's desperate"" fashion. Not only is the workplace and field in general male dominated, but I am more than 20 years younger than the majority of my coworkers- with the exception of the guy who spread the info and a couple others. 

I didn't care initially, I presumed it would blow over; but it indeed has not. He and a few others bring it up in a mocking or teasing way quite regularly. It really wasn't funny the first time, and it definitely wasn't the second, third, or fourth time. I want to highlight that the intention does not feel playful, but instead is delivered in a very demeaning way. I will occasionally get unsolicited advice on my appearance from the same coworker.

I'm looking for advice on what I can do in this situation without turning it into an HR fiasco. I only plan to stay at this job until mid 2026. I want to make my next year enjoyable. What should I say next time he or another coworker brings it up? Something that will really embarrass them perhaps?

,,,,,,,,popular,TIFU by ordering a DNA test as a fun gift for my family and ended up destroying 40 years of family history,"I was scrolling on tiktok and I saw one where some guy bought some ancestry kits to use with his family. It looked fun and a completely different thing compared to the usual gifts and recently I got a tax return so I figured I'd buy some for my family members as a small little gift. I'm very into genealogy and figured we'd learn some cool stuff about our heritage. Fun fact before we continue: my mom's always been proud of her Irish roots from her dad's side.

We ran them up and the results came back: My mom has 0% Irish DNA.  Turns out her ""dad"" wasn't her biological father. I almost fainted. I literally just couldn't believe it. When we asked my 89-year-old grandmother (who has dementia), she admitted to having an affair. She never told anyone for 65 years. I swear I thought this stuff only happens in movies cuz how tf did I end up experiencing this with my own family?!  
My mom hasn't spoken to me in three weeks. She says I destroyed her identity. 

3 weeks later and I still don't know why the fuck did I end up doing this. I wish I could go back in time and never do it

TLDR: I bought some ancestry kits for my family and turns out my mom's dad isn't her biological father

,,,,,,,,popular,AITA for cooking with cooking wine when I am a recovering alcoholic?,"I am a recovering alcoholic and I have been sober for 4 years. One thing that came out of sobriety was my love for cooking. In the beginning, it kept me busy and I didn’t want to drink if I was not hungry. Now, I just love the process of making a delicious meal for myself and loved ones. 

Recently I had my family over for a meal. One of the components of the meal was chicken Marsala. I love chicken Marsala. I make and eat it all the time. One of the ingredients is cooking Marsala wine. 

I brought out the meal and my sister asked what the chicken was. I said it was chicken Marsala. She asked if I used wine. I said I use cooking wine, not regular wine. 

This started an argument about me using and owning cooking wine as an alcoholic. My sister said that I am relapsing by cooking with it and they I have basically been lying to them about being sober. 

I argued back that you don’t get drunk from eating food with cooking wine. You are ingesting some alcohol, but the whole recipe had 2/3 of a cup of wine, my portion has even less. I make this because it’s delicious, not because it gets me buzzed. It also does not trigger any cravings for me to drink. If I buy a bottle, I use it to cook and it sits untouched in the cabinet until I need it to cook next time. 

She ended up leaving and yelled at me to “not talk to her until I’m actually sober”. My mother agrees with me that I am not lying about sobriety by eating foods with wine in them. But when I looked it up online, there are some people who think that I am not being honest if I cook with alcohol.

I told her she could either make a new cake or I wouldn’t be paying the rest. She refused, and now mutual friends are telling me I should’ve just accepted it and gotten a different dessert for my mom. Others say I was right not to risk it.

,,,,,,,,popular,Am I the only one who thinks the Trump “ear shot” was a staged political stunt to humanize him before the election?,"Okay, bear with me. I know this sounds like conspiracy territory — but the more I think about it, the more it *doesn't* sit right.

Let’s look at the facts:

* **The timing?** Impeccable. Right when his campaign was floundering in terms of public sympathy and momentum, he suddenly becomes a “survivor” of a *failed assassination attempt*. Cue media frenzy, rally cries, and instant victim-turned-hero energy.
* **The injury?** His *ear*. Not lethal. Not life-threatening. But *just enough* to be dramatic. It leaves a visible mark without disabling him — the perfect setup for a comeback photo op.
* **The effect?** People who previously saw him as reckless or power-hungry are suddenly seeing a “human” side. A wounded man, supposedly targeted just for telling the truth. It reframes him as the underdog — even a martyr — and historically, those narratives win elections.
* **The rollout?** Way too polished. Speeches, videos, statements — all ready to go like it was part of a campaign strategy. There wasn’t panic, there was *production*.

This feels like a play right out of the authoritarian PR handbook: **create chaos, survive it publicly, and watch your approval ratings climb.** We've seen this tactic before — it's manipulative, emotional propaganda masked as “patriotism.”

I'm not saying it *definitely* was staged — but I’m saying it’s a hell of a lot more convenient than it is convincing.

Curious if anyone else had this gut reaction, or if I’m alone on this hill.

Posts like this should absolutely be flagged and investigated by federal authorities. Under Title 18 U.S. Code § 871, threatening the President is a federal crime, and anyone crossing that line should face prosecution. This isn’t protected speech—it’s a direct threat to national leadership.

If found guilty, they should face the full weight of the law. While treason, as defined in the Constitution, is a specific and narrow charge, actions that promote violence against the government can lead to serious consequences, including imprisonment.

Calls for harm aren’t “opinions”—they’re criminal acts, and it’s time we stop tolerating them under the guise of free speech. AI should be used to track these cowards down, identify them, and bring them to justice. If they hate this country so much, maybe El Salvador or GITMO is exactly where they belong.

,,,,,,,,popular,AITAH for kicking out my gf's sister and her kids out of my flat after my gf gave her the keys,"People around me are saying I am an AH but I need the perspective of uninvolved people.  
My long term gf has my apartment keys, as I have hers. Only unspoken until now but always respected rule was, if you need to go to the other place, just send a text ""Hey going to your place"". Doesn't matter if the other is at home or even responds. Just simply to tell the other you will be at their place.  
  
I was supposed to be away 700km from home for 2 weeks for work related stuff, but 4 days in and our instructor got into an accident. Work tried to find another one, but no such luck on very short notice. They decided at like 10pm to get us the 1st flight home the next day at like 6am, pay us the overtime and the next day at home, then resume our normal work schedule.  
So I get home the next day at like 9am, sent a text to my gf to tell her I am back.  
Getting to my door, I am very confused hearing children screaming inside since none of the people who have my keys have low kids like that (my brother and my gf). I thought I got squatters or something. Opening the door and I see my gf's sister's kid running around after a shower, putting water everywhere. Plates of half finished ravioli on my living room ground. Their suitcases opened in the entrance.  
  
I get inside and see the husband on my couch trying to hook up my PS2(that he must have digged out in my storage room). Getting into a verbal argument with him trying to understand why the fuck they are here. Said my gf told them they could get my flat for 2 weeks while I was gone (they wanted to visit the city for a bit, go to the beach). My gf sent me a text while i was arguing, telling me ""oh ok, btw my sis fam' is at your flat"".  
  
I admit I blew up on him and the sis who left my bedroom in the meantime. Told them to leave immediately. They argued quite a bit, my gf called her sis, then sis put up the speaker so we could all hear, and she said I was embarrassing her, that she told them they could use my place for a while.  
  
I threatened to call the police, also asked my brothers to come.  
They left while cursing me to their children, telling that holidays are over because the mean little sister's boyfriend cast us out.  
I have now all of my gf family on my back, and even some of my own family, saying i could have stayed with at my gf so the kids could have some vacations...  
  
Also. They have read my doctor prescription papers(I put them in a specific order, and it was not the same), and obviously took some of my prescribed meds (opened a box of benzodiazepine...).  
  
AITAH for making them leave?
We pretty much stopped talking about anything else with my gf. I feel like i am being gaslighted. I would never invite people to her apartment like that, especially without telling her. It seems so disrespectful.

,,,,,,,,popular,AITA for not caring that my husband sleeps with other women even though we’re married?,"I (26F) have been married to my husband (38M) for four years. We have two young kids together (M2) and a (F10 months) When we got together, he was very upfront with me about the fact that he doesn’t believe in strict monogamy. He’s always been honest that he sometimes wants to sleep with other women, and I agreed to it under the condition that he’d always be open and respectful about it  no lying, no sneaking around.

It’s not for everyone, I get that. But for us, it works. I’m not the jealous type, and emotionally, we’re very connected. He’s a great dad, really involved, and we live comfortably. He owns a few businesses and does very well financially  We live in a nice big house in a gated neighborhood,and ate able to travel whenever we want and I’ve been able to stay home with the kids without worrying about money.

The issue started last week when my cousin saw him out at a bar with another woman. She apparently recognized him, took a photo, and sent it to my sister. My sister immediately called me in a panic, saying “he’s cheating on you,” and when I told her that I already knew and that it’s not a secret, she completely flipped.

She said I was “letting myself be disrespected” and “hurting my kids” by staying in a marriage like this. She went off about how I’m setting a horrible example and even said, “If you don’t tell Mom and Dad, I will.”

I tried to explain that it’s something we agreed on and that our kids are safe, loved, and have both parents present. But she’s acting like I’m being brainwashed or manipulated. I honestly don’t see the issue. This is our agreement, and it doesn’t affect how we raise our children or how we function as a family.

Now I’m stuck with this anxiety about my family finding out and judging me, even though I’m genuinely okay with the arrangement. I feel like they’re projecting their values onto my marriage and not even trying to understand that different relationships can work in different ways.

Expect Sony to follow soon as well. If you're looking to get a PS5 I would do so sooner rather than later. Same with any games you've been eyeing. You can always wait for sales of course, but it's hard to see what will happen in the future. 

Just thought I would post a friendly reminder and heads up.

**Edit:  I am aware that in other countries the cost of the PS5 has gone up in the last few weeks, but I would expect another massive increase as well. Multiple video games market analysts are saying this is just the beginning. ""Market conditions"" are tarrifs. So be prepared.**

,,,,,,,,popular,I (34m) house sit for other people with the specific goal of going through their things.,"So I’ve been a house sitter/dog watcher for a number of years. It’s truly easy money. I’m excellent at what I do. Odds are your place will be cleaner than when you left for your vacation or work trip. I’ll collect your mail and organize it by the date it was delivered, wash all my towels and bed sheets, never have guest over, etc, etc. However unknown to you and every person who has let me house sit. I’m going to go through your things. Specifically your clothes. Mainly just your clothes. I’ll open and go through every closet, and open and go through all your drawers. Dresses, suits, bathing suits, sweaters, pants, skirts, underwear, scarves, jackets, hosiery, hats, you own it, I’m going to take a look. If I really like something, if it really catches my eye or gets my heart going, I’ll try it on. I’ll stand in front of your mirror and see how it fits me. I’ll wear it around the house and see how it feels. Especially if you’re married woman, for some reason your things in particular I love to look through and wear.

Yes the thrill is doing something I’m not supposed to be doing and the thrill of possibly getting caught in your sexiest outfit. But mainly, if you thought it was nice enough to buy and wear, I want to see why. When I’m done, I’ll fold it back up, or hang it exactly how I found it. You never know. How do I know, because you’ve asked me to house sit again and again and again.

It started when I was back in high school. My friends would have a party, and when everyone was outside, I’d go upstairs and see what their mom had tucked away, then I’d try it on see how I looked, the fold it back and put it away like nothing ever happened. Then I started house sitting, and found out I could have free reign and not have to sneak around.

I’m sure this all sounds incredibly creepy, and like a breach of trust, I’m not looking for advice, just wanted to get it off my chest.
Looking back it does feel wrong, so I regret it, now.",3690.0,879.0,2025-05-01 21:31:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1kck8n3/i_34m_house_sit_for_other_people_with_the/,2025-05-02 10:08:59.277690
,,,,,,,,popular,AITAH for telling my husband I’d rather raise a kid who stands up for themselves than one who blindly obeys?,"I’m 32F, my husband is 31M. We have a 6yrs old son, Leo. He’s a sweet, curious kid who’s really into dinosaurs and loves riding his little blue bike.

Last weekend, I went grocery shopping while my husband stayed home with Leo. Apparently, Leo was outside riding his bike and left it in the front yard while he went inside to get water. A few minutes later, our neighbor, Ms. Robert, came over saying her grandson (8M) saw Leo take his bike. My husband looked out, didn’t see Leo’s bike, and assumed the worst.

He confronted Leo, who insisted he didn’t steal anything. He said his bike was gone. My husband didn’t believe him and told him he was grounded, no TV, no tablet until he told the truth and apologized.

Leo refused, saying, “I didn’t take anyone’s bike! Why are you punishing me when I didn’t do anything?”

Later that afternoon, Ms. Robert returned, visibly embarrassed. Turns out her grandson had taken Leo’s bike to the park because he thought it looked cooler. He made the whole story up to avoid getting in trouble.

When I got home, my husband explained the situation. I figured, “Okay, you’ll apologize to Leo and this will be a learning moment.” But nope he doubled down. He said Leo still needed to be punished for “disrespect” and “refusing to obey.”

I said, “So you want to punish him for telling the truth and standing up for himself?”

He said, “It’s the principle. He needs to listen, even when he doesn’t agree.”

And I said, “I’d rather raise a boy who knows how to stand up for himself than one who just lays down and accepts mistreatment. Especially when he’s innocent.”

We got into a pretty heated argument. He says I’m being unreasonable and dramatic and undermining him as a parent.

But I don’t think I’m wrong for wanting to teach my son that it’s okay to say no when something is unfair, even if it’s coming from a parent.

,,,,,,,,all,Some upper management walked in on a random goodbye party and now it’s really tense…,"I don’t even know how to write this correctly, but it’s laughable how management thinks.

Work in biotech as a service provider associated with a big company that outsources everything. Though this is particular to my company, not the big boys we provide service to.

Anyways, a member of the facilities team was leaving, so we had a brief little pizza party/cake on our lunch break on Friday. A bigger boss, about 2 steps above my direct manager, pops in randomly and asks what’s going on. Turns out the facilities member leaving wasn’t something he was aware of, etc. Their team is already gutted and only has 2 of the normal 5 man team they need. People leaving, etc.

The leaving team member had not alerted our company to him leaving (he was quitting that day) and most of us found out that in that moment. Today, Monday, boss pops in and says we all are in big trouble because we all had a party on Friday and didn’t let management know. That it could be seen as time fraud, etc. That they may restructure our office area in response and possibly a window on the office door.

I just find it really odd that this entire response occurred when it should be more of a time for introspection or investigation as to the why. Based on my understanding, the whole “I’m quitting but not telling you” stems from poor management in that groups chain of command. Why are other teams getting flak for things beyond our control? It’s just so archaic and foolish, I’m surprised this person is even in management.",4046.0,235.0,2025-04-14 14:46:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1jyxzud/some_upper_management_walked_in_on_a_random/,2025-04-14 20:31:29.692066

,,,,,,,,trendingreddits,Suicidal 1,"Dear Friend,

My name is Denzo, and I write this letter with a heart weighed down by despair and desperation. I find myself in a place I never imagined—a place where I feel completely alone, broken, and overwhelmed by life’s burdens.

Every day has become a struggle to survive. I owe money to someone, and that debt is like a dark shadow that follows me everywhere. I haven’t had a decent meal in days, and the gnawing hunger only adds to the constant ache inside me. I trusted those I called friends, only to be left behind when I needed them the most. Now, with no one to turn to, the loneliness and hopelessness have pushed me to the brink. I’ve even started to wonder if ending it all might be the only escape from this crushing pain.

I know this may sound desperate, but I’m reaching out with a plea for help. I need just some money to pull myself back from the edge—a small amount that could be the first step toward getting food, safety, and a chance to seek the help I desperately need. This isn’t just about money; it’s about having a lifeline when everything seems lost.

If you can find it in your heart to help, no matter how small the contribution, you would be giving me a reason to believe that there is still hope in this dark world. Your kindness could be the spark that reignites my will to live and helps me find a way to rebuild my shattered life.

Thank you for taking the time to read my plea. I hold onto the hope that someone out there understands my pain and will offer the hand I so desperately need.

With all the hope I have left,

r/Slowcooking is a food-related subreddit for sharing ideas, recipes or pictures in which a ""slow cooker"" was used in the preparation of meals.

Many people think a slow cooker is named a ""crock-pot,"" however this is a trademarked name of just one manufacturer.

Who emerged to find Jesus. Who was written off as a has-been by the end of the '80s and who suddenly shifted gears, releasing some of the strongest music of his career beginning in the late '90s.

Ladies and gentlemen — Columbia recording artist Bob Dylan!

,,,,,,,,popular,AITA for turning my sister away for the second time after she slept with the father of my children while I was with him and then came to me when he cheated and passed on STDs/STIs to her?,"I (27f) have three children with my now ex Kon (29m). 10 months ago my sister (26f) confessed that she and Kon had slept together the week before and she said she regretted it and needed us to be okay. She told me it was a mistake and she got caught up in a moment because she had a crush on Kon and she needed me not to hate her for it. That she loved me and wanted us to make things work. Kon didn't even try to deny it. He told me he'd been sleeping around for years and that he slept with my sister more than once. My sister denied it strongly. I broke up with him immediately and told her to get lost. I said I never wanted to see her again and that she disgusted and repulsed me and I didn't care how bad she felt, I wanted her to feel bad, I wanted her to hurt and she would never hurt as much as I was right then so forget about me.

I got checked after I broke up with Kon to make sure he didn't give me anything with all the cheating. I was negative for all STDs and I'm incredibly thankful for that. With the amount of cheating he talked about I'm still surprised I didn't catch anything.

She ended up dating Kon because I rejected her. Or that was the story she told others. She said she felt guilty and needed some good to come from this because clearly I would never give her the time of day again. And that's true. I swore to myself that I would not forgive her. Even through therapy I have become more secure in the belief that what she did broke our relationship beyond repair and regardless of whether it was one time (which I don't believe) or a full affair it was wrong and we'll never come back from it. I really don't care what happens to her and if she died tomorrow I would not grieve or make an appearance at her funeral. 

Recently my sister found out Kon had cheated on her and he didn't only cheat but he passed along some STDs/STIs. I don't know specifics. I believe she's also waiting to make sure he didn't give her HIV. Although I can't say I paid enough attention to know if that was a big concern or just them being cautious. But she thought that experience would make me more forgiving of her. She was wrong. She showed up at my place and I shut the door in her face without saying a word. She showed up at our brothers house while I was heading inside and he shooed her but she told me how sorry she was again and how scared she was and how much she needed me. I ignored her and kept going and our brother told her she wasn't welcome.

She tried again and this time I did respond. I told her I do not care and if anything she deserves everything she got after what she did and how stupid she was in the end. She told me she needed me and that she was scared. I told her just like when I found out my partner of 8 years and father of my children was cheating and I could have used my sister only she betrayed me as well by cheating with him. She said it was one time and she would have been there for me and I told her I didn't want her disgusting self to touch me. Because I said that's how I saw her now a disgusting backstabber. I told her I don't care if he's given her every STD under the sun, because I want nothing more to do with her and she can die in a hole for all I care.

I haven't seen her since. Apparently she's very distraught and she's also the topic of gossip in our social circles. She lost most of our shared friends and a few have shared a similar sentiment to me on her. But a couple have asked me if I don't even feel a little bad for being so cruel to her and turning her away a second time even after all her apologies. They said they felt like I should have found a way to work through this because we were close for such a long time and sisters are for life or whatever stupid crap they said.

I don't feel guilty. I don't even feel bad for her or have any kind of empathy. AITA though?",4192.0,606.0,2025-04-14 14:12:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1jyxblg/aita_for_turning_my_sister_away_for_the_second/,2025-04-14 21:09:03.112324

,,,,,,,,all,Fuck All Ya'll,"2025 has sucked. I have been full of barely contained rage since November, but today's press conference where the current administration laughed while refusing a SCOTUS order and talking about sending anyone they deemed a ""violent criminal"" to CECOT was my breaking point.

My fucks to give are gone. I did not spend more than two decades fighting terrorists and despots to watch the country turn into a terrorist nation run by a despot. 

So, all that said:

Trump, fuck you. 

Vance, fuck you. 

Mike Johnson, fuck you. 

Stephen Miller, fuck you too. 

Elon Musk, fuck you. 

Vought, Thiel, and The Heritage Foundation; fuck all ya'll.

Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, fuck you. Roberts, Kavanaugh, and Coney-Barret, I challenge you to do the right thing and fix the fuck ups you have had. 

Rubio, Hegseth, and the entire Trump administration, fuck you. 

Anyone who wears a fucking Trump lapel pin or supports MAGA, fuck you too. 

If you're not into actual civil liberties and ""justice for all,"" fuck all ya'll.

It is time for the Judicial and Legislative branches to do their jobs and REMOVE Trump. It is time for the Republican party to take back their party and REPLACE the MAGA parasites. 

It is time for the Democratic party to stop being complicit, find their courage, and REPAIR our broken nation.

Do not sit down. Do not remain silent. Say fuck you to that fat, orange fuck ruining the country and RECLAIM the term ""FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT!""

Do everything you can to effect positive change. 

Fuck 'em.

EDIT 1: Thanks to the folks who've pointed out my incorrect names of a couple of SCOTUS folks. I was fat-fingering that in the passenger seat of a moving car while suppressing my rage. 

EDIT 2: By popular demand, I added Stephen Miller.

,,,,,,,,all,I held on too long and all it did was hurt my daughter,"My daughter had multiple congenital birth defects that led to a lifetime of complications. With medically complex kids you fix one problem and create two more.

 She lived 11 years. It was probably 9 years too long. She lived most of her life in hospitals. Literally months at a time. She would sometimes be home a week or two and then end up back in. I don't think she ever spent more than two consecutive months out of the hospital in her entire life, until she went on palliative care. 

She was more comfortable in the hospital than anywhere else. How sad is that. She was the ""warrior"" kid. That was her whole identity. Making cards for her nurses and decorating her medical equipment and being Tough with a capital T. That was all she had. Never went to school, not in any meaningful capacity. Never played a sport or an instrument. Never had any real friends to speak of. Never had the health to take up any real hobbies. Just an entire life made up of surgeries, shots and nurses and fucking medical equipment to decorate. I gave her a pathetic life. 

There wasn't a single intervention I wasn't willing to put her through to buy more time. She was the happiest, most accepting kid I've ever met but in the last six months she was done. I refused to listen. She asked me over and over again if she could just ""stop"". I would push until she shut up and went along with what I wanted. Why did I do that. She wanted to make me happy but she knew she was done. Selfish. She died incredibly agitated and upset. I think she was scared to let go because she knew what it was going to do to me. I wasn't strong enough to let go. I'm so so sorry. ",4575.0,193.0,2025-04-15 03:48:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1jzg3w9/i_held_on_too_long_and_all_it_did_was_hurt_my/,
,,,,,,,,all,AITAH for telling my sister to find another babysitter after she said I “don’t know real stress” ‘cause I don’t have kids?,"So boom. I’m 30F, no kids, no husband, livin my best soft life. I got a decent job, my apartment stays clean, and I sleep like a baby every night. My sister (33F) has 3 little gremlins under the age of 7 and swears she’s the only person on Earth who’s ever been tired.

Last week she hits me up on some “Hey, can you watch the kids this weekend? Me and my husband need a break before we lose our minds.”

Cool. I was about to say yes, until she hits me with:

“I mean, it’s not like you got anything going on. You don’t have kids. You’re probably just chillin anyway.”

,,,,,,,,all,AITA - told mom she can bill me using the tuition money she stole from me,"When I (m33) was preparing to go to uni, my mom confessed that there was no tuition money for me. Through the years my dad would give her cash to deposit but she only did the first one. She spent the rest. TBH I wasn't even surprised. I was used to being disappointed by her. She promised that she would ""pay me back"" and asked that I never tell me dad. So for four years I thanked them for the tuition money while I took out loans.

For reasons to do with her narcissism, I have an arms length relationship with her, but she would say we're pretty close as she assumes my smiling and nodding while she drones on about the same stories is a relationship.

We have a family cottage that she puts above everything else. She lives there about 90 days of the year. I've been going there with my gf for about 4 days for a couple summers which she begrudges as it takes away from her time. My dad supports my going which is how I pull it off. 

She recently told me that it was time for me to start paying for some of the maintenance on the cottage since I use it. She actually suggested 1k which is wildly disproportionate. I told her she could take it out of the tuition IOU and we could negotiate the amount with dad.

She was speechless. She texted me later to say that it manipulative to bring up the tuition and to threaten to tell dad. It went on and on. 

I've been thinking about it and First, I'm hurt/offended that she can't just do a nice thing for me, she has to get something for it. 
Second, I guess I'm not really over the whole tuition thing. 

WITAH for bringing up ancient history and not paying her for use of the cottage?

Edited to add: at the time, it never occurred to me that I should have told him. I thought I was doing the right thing by protecting both of them. That pretty much summarizes my childhood.

,,,,,,,,popular,"AITA for asking my husband not to go on a trip with a woman who openly flirts with him, and feeling betrayed when he did anyway?","Hi everyone,
I’m a 32F and I’ve been married to my husband (let's call him Joe) for 8 years, together for 10. In all that time, we’ve always prioritized each other’s emotional well-being. If something hurt one of us, we didn’t do it again — no matter what. We valued having a happy spouse more than being “right.” Because of this, my love and trust for him grew immensely. I was certain he’d never do anything that would break my heart.

But here I am, heartbroken and disappointed.

Joe owns a company, and we work together. Financially, we’re in a great place. Recently, through Joe’s father, we got the chance to bid for a major government contract — a massive opportunity. Due to its scale, several companies are teaming up, and one key company involved (without whom the deal won’t happen) is led by a very attractive, flirty woman. She’s the CEO and has openly flirted with Joe in front of me.

We both noticed her behavior, and in order to avoid misunderstandings or conflict, we decided to work on the bid together. Things were okay until one meeting where, during a break, she touched Joe’s arm and said something like, “If I had a husband like you, I’d never leave his side. You’re someone every woman wants, but sometimes even that’s not enough — someone else might steal your mind.”

I snapped and responded, “I’m not following him — he just never leaves my side.”
She brushed it off as a joke, but I know it wasn’t. I saw the look in her eyes — and women just know.

Later, I talked to Joe about it. He admitted she was crossing a line and that he was uncomfortable, but didn’t react strongly to avoid jeopardizing the deal. I wasn’t thrilled, but I tried to understand.

Then today, I found out that I was excluded from a 3-day site visit for the bid — a trip requested by that woman. Only five people are going, and Joe is one of them. When I heard, I told him I was extremely uncomfortable with this, and asked him not to go. I begged, actually. I said the deal wasn’t worth this. We’re financially stable and don’t need this contract.

But he went anyway.
Even after everything I said, he left without me.

Something broke in me. I trusted him with my whole heart. I truly believed he’d never choose anything over my peace of mind. Now I feel like he did. He left me behind. And it hurts so deeply that part of me doesn’t even care anymore — if he comes back, if he ends up with that woman — I feel numb.

A part of me says, “Come on, 10 amazing years — don’t throw it all away.”
Another part wants to take off my wedding ring, send him a photo, and file for divorce.

So... AITA for asking him not to go?
And how do I even begin to deal with these emotions?",2179.0,1617.0,2025-04-14 22:22:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1jz8znw/aita_for_asking_my_husband_not_to_go_on_a_trip/,

I was on break at work in mid-2014 when I read a newspaper article in which he was pimping his latest snake oil and vaporware. He said something that my boss at the time would say from time to time.

My boss was a liar and a crook, took credit for every success, and placed blame on every failure that happened anywhere near him.

He's a textbook example of a narcissistic sociopath.

It clicked in my brain, and I realized Musk, like my boss, has never created a single thing. He comes up with an idea and tells people to get to work on it, assigning a due date that has absolutely no basis in reality, similar to ""It's March 20th. You can all cobble this together in a month. We'll release it on 4-20!!! It's going to be awesome because it's like a joke, it's funny!!!""

He makes promises that others have to fulfill, taking credit for the work everyone else had to do to develop the technology that didn't exist until the real engineers invented it.

My distaste took a year to morph into a loathing of everything that he stands for.

In the intervening decade, he's never let me down, continuing the grift, shady behavior, lying, and all-around bad behavior that I noticed 11 years ago.

>They needed to get the president alone.
>
>On April 9, financial markets were going haywire. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick wanted President Trump to put a pause on his aggressive global tariff plan. But there was a big obstacle: Peter Navarro, Trump’s tariff-loving trade adviser, who was constantly hovering around the Oval Office. 
> 
>Navarro isn’t one to back down during policy debates and had stridently urged Trump to keep tariffs in place, even as corporate chieftains and other advisers urged him to relent. And Navarro had been regularly around the Oval Office since Trump’s “Liberation Day” event. 
>So that morning, when Navarro was scheduled to meet with economic adviser Kevin Hassett in a different part of the White House, Bessent and Lutnick made their move, according to multiple people familiar with the intervention.
>
>They rushed to the Oval Office to see Trump and propose a pause on some of the tariffs—without Navarro there to argue or push back. They knew they had a tight window. The meeting with Bessent and Lutnick wasn’t on Trump’s schedule.
>
>The two men convinced Trump of the strategy to pause some of the tariffs and to announce it immediately to calm the markets. They stayed until Trump tapped out a Truth Social post, which surprised Navarro, according to one of the people familiar with the episode. Bessent and press secretary Karoline Leavitt almost immediately went to the cameras outside the White House to make a public announcement. 

So the Liberation Day steep tariff percentages were only put on a 90-day pause because Navarro was in a different room on that April 9th morning

I miscarried yesterday afternoon about 12pm. I’ve never had a miscarriage before and this baby was so wished for so it’s all so fresh and I’m sobbing right now so I apologise in advance if it doesn’t make a whole lot of sense. My husband turned 27 yesterday. 

I 26F *was* pregnant with mine and my husband’s 27M 2nd child. Yesterday, I was 8 weeks pregnant. The day before yesterday we saw a beautiful heart beat flicking on the screen and today I’m devastated. I was playing with our 2 year old when I felt a pressure in my lower abdomen. Not long later, I noticed bleeding and I let my husband know immediately that I had discomfort and bleeding. Before long I had passed what I believe is the fetus and I messaged him “I think I lost the baby”. I wanted to keep him updated and I guess I was seeking some kind of emotional support. I asked if he could come home and he said “of course, if it’s urgent”. I said I think it is because the pain and bleeding is getting worse and I’m starting to feel lightheaded and our 2 year old is unattended in his playroom right now. We have no friends or family near that I could call who would get to us quicker than he could. 

I had to clean myself up, crawl down stairs to take paracetamol, make my son his lunch and then put him down for a nap. At this point my husband still isn’t home. He was working approx 30 mins away and took closer to 60 mins to get back. Hours later when I asked, it was because he’d stopped at Tesco to pick up some beers. 

I ended up very poorly, losing lots of blood, lightheaded, vomiting etc and he had to take me to A&E. By the time I was discharged it was almost 8pm. Last week, I had said I’d make him his favourite dinner for his birthday which he reminded me when we were almost home. I said I wasn’t feeling up to it and that whatever takeaway he wants is on me. He said “for fuck sake” under his breath and then muttered something along the lines of “this bullshit has ruined my birthday”. He didn’t stop to get any takeaway. He just drove straight home. He put our son to bed and I went to bed and I’m not sure what he did after. I didn’t see him this morning as he had already left for work. He’s not messaged me all day and he got home a few hours ago (it’s now 8. 40pm) and he’s been giving me silent treatment. I tried to speak to him about an hour or so ago and he ignored me and I called him a disgrace. He slammed the bedroom door and locked me out of the bedroom. His mum has since messaged me and said I need to be patient as he’s also had a loss. She didn’t ask how I was or anything.

I (25F) have been dating my boyfriend Matt (27M) for almost two years. His family is *very* close, and his mom in particular has always been a little… possessive? I’ve tried not to make a big deal out of it, but it’s clear she doesn’t like that I “take up his time,” and she’s made passive-aggressive comments like, “I hope I don’t lose my son to some girl,” even though we’ve been together for a while and I’ve made every effort to be kind and respectful to her.

Anyway, last weekend was Matt’s birthday. He invited me to dinner with his family at a nice restaurant. I dressed up, got him a gift I knew he’d love, and was honestly looking forward to the night.

When we arrived, I noticed his mom had saved the seat right next to him for herself. That’s fine, whatever — I sat on his other side.

But right before we ordered, his mom made a “joke” about how I always need to be next to Matt and said, “Let’s see how you handle a little separation!” Then she literally stood up, looked at me, and said, “Scooch, sweetie,” motioning for me to move down a seat so she could sit between us.

Everyone at the table laughed — Matt included.

I was so stunned I just quietly got up and moved. For about five minutes I sat there, feeling small and humiliated while she leaned over Matt like he was her date.

So I stood up, grabbed my bag, and said, “Actually, I think I’m gonna head out. Hope you have a great birthday, Matt.” And I left.

Matt blew up my phone later saying I *completely overreacted*, embarrassed him in front of his family, and “can’t take a joke.” His mom texted me a “sorry you were so sensitive” message, which just made it worse.

Now he’s not speaking to me until I apologize. I honestly feel like they were the rude ones — but it *was* his birthday dinner, so now I’m second-guessing everything.

,,,,,,,,popular,"Euch ist nicht klar, wie viel eures Geld wirklich an die alte Generation fließt.","Letztens kam mir ein Gedanke: Als arbeitende Bevölkerung zahlen wir nicht nur Rentenversicherungsbeiträge für die ältere Generation. In Deutschland fließt noch viel mehr unserer Produktivität an Rentner. Weil mich das am Wochenende beschäftigt hat, habe ich eine einfache Website erstellt, auf der ihr sehen könnt, wie viel eures Gehalts an die ältere Generation geht: https://rentner.pages.dev/ . (Und ihr könnt sogar eine Urkunde ausdrucken! :D)
Folgendes wird oft übersehen:

- Die Krankenkasse funktioniert in Deutschland ebenfalls als Umlageverfahren, und bereits heute fließen 51,4 % der Ausgaben an Menschen über 65.
- Die Pflegeversicherung.
- Ein großer Teil eurer Steuern im Bundeshaushalt (ca. 20 %) wird als Zuschuss für die Rentenversicherung verwendet.
- Mit euren Steuern werden auch Pensionen finanziert. 2023 beliefen sich die Ausgaben des Staates für Pensionen, Hinterbliebenenversorgung und Beihilfen auf rund 85,9 Milliarden Euro.
- 8,2 % des GEZ-Beitrags gehen für Betriebsrenten drauf.

Ich weiß, es fehlt noch einiges (z. B. Kapitalerträge, Umsatzsteuer) und manches ist vereinfacht (z. B. Steuerklassen). Ja, das bezieht den Arbeitgeberanteil mit ein. Trotzdem soll es euch sensibilisieren: Das System ist jetzt schon grenzwertig und wird mit jedem Jahr kritischer.

Und jetzt das Interessante: Die arbeitende Bevölkerung scheint das gar nicht ändern zu wollen. Bei der letzten Bundestagswahl hat die Linke bei jungen Wählern den ersten Platz geholt. Die Linke will die Renten erhöhen, eine Mindestrente einführen, die über dem heutigen Durchschnitt liegt, und das Renteneintrittsalter senken.

Tolle Ausgangslage. Aber ich hänge mir jetzt erst mal eine Urkunde an die Wand.",1166.0,685.0,2025-04-19 11:10:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/Finanzen/comments/1k2s79n/euch_ist_nicht_klar_wie_viel_eures_geld_wirklich/,2025-04-19 14:10:45.616285

My partner has no idea that that sequence of events just ended our 6 year relationship.,"Nearly 3 years of living in this spot and I can't remember if he's cleaned the damn thing once. He's lied about cleaning it after cleaning litter boxes and I would literally hop in to shower and feel the nastiness still sitting there in a layer of slime and grossness. I went on strike and haven't touched it and finally broke today.

Today I'm going out for live music and some reading at a local spot. I told myself I'd clean the litter boxes today so, before showering, I decided to dump em and scrub em in the shower. While sitting there, looking at the orange slime that has built up around the tub, I decided that I was finally done. 

Cleaned the litter boxes, sprayed down the tub and walls and curtain, then hopped in and scrubbed the whole thing down before cleaning myself. 

I rinsed brown/brackish water off of the walls multiple times. Scrubbed the orange slime away, and when I was done in the time I had it was STILL barely passable. It was sick. I can't believe I've been showering in this mess all while begging and pleading for this grown ass man to just fucking HELP OUT with the nasty ass apartment we have together. The kicker? He gets mad at ME when I get upset about things 😂 apparently not using your Super Special Big Boy Cleanup Time Voice  and instead getting frustrated that a 28 year old man doesn't help out more makes you an evil bitch who doesn't understand how rude they are to people. Go figure. 

Anyway. Im done. I don't even think he realizes. I just continued getting ready and went along with my plans and walked out the door with barely a ""see you later"". I was arguing with him silently in my head the rest of the time but didn't even bother starting up for real because it genuinely was not worth ruining my night. 

Anyway. I just needed to get this off my chest. There's so much more I could rant about but having this feeling of being like ""actually, screw this. Im done.""

Come the time and day of the date and she isnt there. I wait and check my phone and she hadnt texted me anything. She finally arrives 15 minutes late.
She greets me but doesnt even apologize for being late. I ask her why she was late.
She shrugs and says that taking ready just took longer than expected. I ask her If before she drove here she already knew she wouldnt make it in time. She says yes. I ask her why she didnt text me. She said she didnt because she was only ""a little late"", and started looking visibly annnoyed.

At that point I excused myself, said our values dont align and left her there.

,,,,,,,,popular,FINAL WARNING: Pierre Poilievre Is a Danger to Canada,"**FINAL WARNING: Pierre Poilievre Is a Danger to Canada**  
*This is a direct message to every Canadian who values truth, compassion, and democracy.*

Canada is on the brink of catastrophe. This upcoming federal election isn’t just another round at the ballot box — it is the most important election of your lifetime. This is the moment that will define who we are as a country. This is your *final warning*.

  and the Conservative Party are not just wrong for Canada — they are a **threat** to everything Canada stands for. If you think we’re exaggerating, look south of the border. The United States ignored the warnings. They embraced Donald Trump, a narcissistic, authoritarian figure propped up by billionaires and conspiracy theorists. Their democracy has never recovered. And now, we are staring down a mirror image of that disaster — right here, at home, in Pierre Poilievre.

Make no mistake: **Pierre Poilievre is Canada's Trump.**  
He idolizes Donald Trump. He echoes the same rhetoric. He amplifies the same hate. He promotes the same division and chaos. And now, he has cozied up to **Elon Musk**, one of the richest men alive, who has shown blatant disregard for truth, workers' rights, or public good — just like Poilievre.

**Here’s what Pierre Poilievre truly stands for:**

* **Anti-union**: Poilievre has consistently voted *against* workers’ rights and *against* union protections. He has no interest in protecting the working class — his loyalty lies with CEOs, not you.
* **Wants to cut the federal dental plan**, which helps millions of Canadians. Under his leadership, the working class will suffer while the wealthy celebrate.
* **Plans to slash healthcare**, pushing us toward a privatized system where only the rich get proper care.
* **Will gut public services**, laying off public sector workers and slashing budgets that keep our communities safe and supported.
* **Will sell us out**: He will **bow to Trump**, **sell our industries to the U.S.**, and even make backroom deals with **China**, putting our sovereignty and economy at risk.
* **Does not value women**: He has a history of ignoring women's rights, supporting regressive policies, and surrounding himself with misogynistic voices.
* **Has spread lies**: His entire campaign is built on *fabricated numbers*, *false promises*, and *gaslighting the public*.
* **Supports extremist ideologies**: He’s flirted with conspiracy theorists and has amplified hate-filled voices.
* **Anti-science, anti-progress**: From climate denial to blocking advancements in green jobs, he drags Canada backward.
* **Opposes reconciliation with Indigenous peoples**, showing disregard for justice, truth, and healing.
* **Wants to criminalize dissent**, clamping down on protests and threatening your right to speak up.
* **Pushes culture wars**, division, and fear over unity and hope.
* **Wants to turn our media into state-run mouthpieces** or destroy them altogether.
* **Stokes racism and division**, because he knows hate wins votes when truth doesn’t.
* **He will not govern — he will rule**, and if elected, democracy as we know it will never be the same.

This is not fear-mongering. This is *reality*.

**If you are thinking about voting for Pierre Poilievre, understand this:**

  

This is not about left vs. right anymore — this is about **Canada vs. collapse**.

   
If you haven’t voted yet — **vote to protect your country, your community, your children’s future.**  
Do not fall for his lies. Do not become a cautionary tale. Open your eyes, Canada. Wake up, before it’s too late.

Because when democracy dies, it never announces itself with a bang. It dies slowly — through the election of men like Pierre Poilievre, while good people stay silent.

**Ask yourself: How much do you value your democracy?**

We need to stop accommodating these people by being polite and thoughtful and considerate. We need to start being blatant assholes to them, because nothing else we do seems to be working. Don't say ""excuse me"", say ""get out of the way."" Don't skirt around a group of people blocking an entire pathway - walk through the middle of their group.

He invited me to go to dinner with his family and I accepted, but he casually mentioned, “Maybe you could wear something with sleeves? Just so we don’t start any drama.” I asked what he meant, and he said his grandparents are very old-school and might not react well to my tattoos. He said he didn’t want the night to be awkward.  
I told him I wasn’t going to hide part of myself to make his family more comfortable. He said it’s not about hiding, it’s about respect. I told him respect goes both ways, and I shouldn’t have to pretend to be someone I’m not.  
He got upset and said I was overreacting and making it a bigger deal than it is. I told him that I would go to the dinner but that I wouldn't cover my tattoos. But then he asked me to please not attend, that if I was only going to be difficult, it would be better not to be there.  
That really rubbed me the wrong way and made me feel confused, because I think maybe I did behave badly and I shouldn't have reacted so vehemently against the idea. I don't want to cause drama with his family, but I have had a hard time feeling comfortable in my skin and learning to deal with the stigma people have towards me because of my tattoos... and I don't want to go back and hide again, plus I don't think I would be honest with his family either if I show myself as I am not.

,,,,,,,,popular,YSK How to stop a dog attack.,"Why YSK: After seeing multiple posts about dog attacks and people in the comments giving absolutely terrible advice, you should know the only proven way to stop a dog attack is by oxygen deprivation.

Using a spare lead, pass the rope or cord under the attacking dog’s neck, then pass it through the loop and cinch it tight like a noose. Hold it until the dog releases it’s target either for air or until it passes out.

Do not use your hands to try to pry the dog’s mouth open. Do not try to make loud noises as it will likely heighten the attacking dog. Do not try to use your own body to attempt to subdue the dog whether by holding it down or trying to choke it yourself. For god sake don’t stick your finger up it’s butt. The only way is to force the dog to try to breathe by depriving it of oxygen.

Edit: This is advice for a dog attacking another dog or animal. If you suspect a dog may attack you try get up high like on a car. If the attack is imminent, cross your arms against your chest & try to maintain your stance & hope it loses interest. If you are pulled to the ground maintain crossed arms, ball-up, & protect your vital organs & face & pray it loses interest or someone can help.",9341.0,1248.0,2025-04-22 22:15:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/1k5gc9o/ysk_how_to_stop_a_dog_attack/,2025-04-23 12:56:52.751422
,,,,,,,,popular,Tesla reports disappointing quarterly results as automotive revenue plunges 20%,"Tesla reported a miss on the top and bottom lines in its first-quarter earnings report on Tuesday as automotive revenue plunged 20% from a year earlier.

Here are the key numbers compared with LSEG expectations.

* **Earnings per share**: 27 cents adjusted vs. 39 cents estimated
* **Revenue**: $19.34 billion vs. $21.11 billion estimated

Total revenue slid 9% from $21.3 billion a year earlier. Automotive revenue dropped 20% to $14 billion from $17.4 billion in the same period last year.

Tesla said one reason for the decline was the need to update lines at its four vehicle factories to start making a refreshed version of its popular Model Y SUV. The company also pointed to lower average selling prices and sales incentives as a drag on revenue and profit.

Net income plummeted 71% to $409 million, or 12 cents a share, from $1.39 billion or 41 cents a year ago.

It’s been a brutal start to the year for Tesla, with CEO Elon Musk spending much of his time in President Donald Trump’s White House, overseeing an effort to dramatically downsize the federal government. The president’s sweeping tariffs plan has led to concerns that costs will increase for parts and materials crucial for electric vehicle production, including manufacturing equipment, automotive glass, printed circuit boards and battery cells.

Tesla shares are down 41% so far in 2025, and suffered their worst quarterly drop since 2022 in the period that ended in March. The stock was little changed in extended trading on Tuesday.

The company refrained from promising growth this year and said it will “revisit our 2025 guidance in our Q2 update.”

In its shareholder deck, Tesla cautioned investors that “uncertainty in the automotive and energy markets continues to increase as rapidly evolving trade policy adversely impacts the global supply chain and cost structure of Tesla and our peers.” The company said this “dynamic,” and “changing political sentiment” could have a meaningful near-term impact on demand for its products.

Tesla has faced widespread protests in the U.S. and Europe, where Musk has actively supported Germany’s far-right AfD party. Earlier this month, the company reported a 13% decline in first quarter deliveries from a year earlier to 336,681.

Tesla has been struggling to keep pace with lower-cost competitors in China, and is a laggard in the robotaxi market, which is currently dominated in the U.S. by Alphabet’s Waymo. The company has promised to launch its first driverless ride-hailing offering in Austin, Texas, in June.

The company reassured investors on Tuesday that it remains on track for a “pilot launch” in Austin by that point, and to begin building its humanoid robots on a pilot production line in Fremont, California, this year.

Operating income in the quarter slid 66% to $400 million from $1.17 billion a year earlier, resulting in a 2.1% operating margin. The company cited an increase in expenses tied to artificial intelligence projects as one factor in the decline.

The company would have lost money on automotive sales without environmental regulatory credits during the quarter. Revenue from the credits, which Tesla receives for selling fully electric vehicles, increased to $595 million from $432 million in the same quarter last year.

Energy generation and storage revenue jumped 67% in the quarter to $2.73 billion from $1.64 billion a year ago. The company said growth in AI infrastructure is “creating an outsized opportunity for our Energy storage products to stabilize the grid, shift energy when it is needed most and provide additional power capacity.”

Tesla uses foreign suppliers for its energy business. The company said “increasing tariffs may cause market volatility and near-term impacts to supply and demand.”

Naturally, sparks flew. We started sending each other transmogs. We shared a garrison. I gave her full priority on loot — even over myself. Love makes you do wild things.

Eventually, I worked up the courage to ask if she wanted to meet IRL. That’s when she said, “Sure — by the way, I’m Greg.”

Greg is 42, lives in Ohio, and has a beard that could tank Mythic Razageth. Turns out Greg has been healing me through emotional AND magical damage this whole time.

,,,,,,,,all,AITA for bringing a much older guy to Easter dinner after my dad left my mom for someone close to my age?,"I (18F) moved out at 15 when I got into a boarding school abroad. When I was 12, my dad (45M) cheated on my mom (43F) with a woman (26F) who was 20 at the time. They ended up divorcing, and he’s been with her ever since. She’s only a few years older than me, and for the past few years, she’s been at every family holiday. She’s clearly only after his money, but hes too stupid and stubborn to understand. 

This year, for Easter, I flew back home and asked a friend of mine (38M) to come with me and pretend to be my boyfriend just for a few days at my home. 

After dinner, my dad pulled me aside and told me he felt uncomfortable with the situation. I told him I didn’t do anything wrong and that, after him, love has no age. He told me that I ruined everyones Easter by being selfish and bringing someone his age to dinner.

I flew back to school, but now I’m getting messages from a few relatives saying I should apologize to my dad and break up with my “boyfriend.” I haven’t responded. I don’t think I’m in the wrong because hes made my life uncomfortable since the moment he cheated on my mom. 

AITA?

Edit- seems like many think its a lie lol, i would too, but i met my friend in a book club when i moved to the us (im from europe) and he’s been a great father figure to me tbh. When i had no friends there he would buy me dinner and actually spend time with me, and hes recently divorced (from his hs sweetheart) so he would’ve spent easter alone anyway, therefore decided to take him with and show him around. 

I KNOW THIS IS IMMATURE PEOPLE! I know its extremely immature of me, but I wanted to show him how it feels. Thanks a lot for the advice everyone, Ill update for Christmas, lol.

,,,,,,,,all,The “support strike” and Necros’ comments – why this actually matters,"With the recent “support strike” going on in Marvel Rivals, I wanted to share an experience that really shows why many support players are speaking up and had enough right now.

Necros outright said on stream that he hates support players and called them “idiots” and “morons.” That kind of statement, coming from a big voice in the community, does real damage. Streamers don’t get to opt out of influence — if you have a following, what you say matters in your community. And now we’re seeing the consequences of that.

In a recent match, I was playing support and I wasn’t doing bad — nearly 50k healing, only two deaths, same damage blocked as our DPS, and just 10k less total damage dealt. Still, someone in voice chat told me: “Necros was right, you support players are all brain dead.” And that’s the exact problem. This mindset is being validated and amplified, and it makes playing the role feel increasingly thankless. 

To be clear, most support players aren’t playing support because they lack the mechanical skill to play DPS. They can play DPS — just like there are mechanically easy and difficult heroes in every role. The reason a lot of us choose support is because it’s actually fulfilling and fun for us to keep a teammate alive, or to set someone else up for a kill. For us, that’s just more fun than chasing elims.

We’re not asking to be glorified or seen as the “hardest” role - because I don’t think we are. We just want basic respect. It’s tiring to be called brain dead or worthless when your stats are solid and you’re playing your role the way it’s meant to be played.

Honestly, the players who show appreciation are usually tanks.(Especially non-dive/frontline tanks) They know they’d go down in seconds without healing. But a lot of this support hate seems to come from DPS mains, who can usually get by on health packs and mobility.

If you’re someone who plays DPS or tank, take a second to think about the support on your team. Are they really the problem — or are they just an easy target? This game doesn’t work without teamwork, so if your support is getting dove a lot stay with them and protect them, you keeping your support alive, and preventing the enemy teams divers from getting kills is still great value for your team.",2947.0,323.0,2025-04-23 12:11:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1k5vjdy/the_support_strike_and_necros_comments_why_this/,2025-04-23 16:29:29.282961

,,,,,,,,popular,AITAH for refusing to make my SIL’s wedding cake for free?,"I (29f) run a bakery business that I've built from the ground up during the past five years. It started as a hobby during college, but now it’s a registered business with steady clients, a dedicated workspace, and consistent orders during each month. 

I do mostly for weddings, birthdays, and other events. I take a lot of pride in what I do, and it’s not just “baking for fun” anymore. This is my livelihood.  

My SIL (33F) is getting married at the beginning of June. She’s my wife’s older sister. We’re on friendly terms, but she’s always had this vibe like she doesn’t really take what I do seriously.  

She’s made comments like, “It must be nice getting to play in the kitchen all day,” or, “You’re lucky people will pay for something they could probably learn on YouTube.” Always with a smile, like it’s a joke but not really. 

I've brushed these comments off in the past, since they weren't happening all the time and I just didn't want to stir up any drama. 


So earlier this month, she asked if I’d make her wedding cake. I said sure and asked what she had in mind. She sent over inspo pics of a four-tier cake with smooth buttercream, floral piping, and real flowers on top and cascading down one side. 

She wanted it to be a chocolate sponge with raspberry filling in terms of taste. Plus, she wanted for me it to deliver to the venue myself on the morning of the wedding rather than picking it up the day before herself.

After we got done discussing everything, I gave her a quote over the phone with a generous family discount, and SIL replied almost instantly, that she didn't think I'd be charging her and the cake would essentially be a wedding gift. 

I told her that I don’t typically do wedding cakes as gifts because of how much time and work they take, but I’d be happy to buy her something from her registry instead or still make the cake at the discounted price if she wanted.

She wasn’t happy. Said I was being transactional and that it was just a cake and I clearly didn’t want to be part of her special day before hanging up on me. 

To be clear, I have made cakes for free before. But those were small, simple ones for people I care about, or for friends who were going through a rough time.  This isn't that  my SIL and her fiance can pay for the cake, and it's not like she's exactly respected my work in the past. 


Meanwhile, SIL has been telling anyone who will listen that I’m making her big day about myself and trying to “profit off her happiness.” Seriously. 

My MIL called and she didn’t really ask how I felt or try to understand where I was coming from, she just seemed overwhelmed and kind of desperate to stop this from turning into a bigger family fight. She kept going on about how stressed my SIL was and how she was being a bit much, but basically begged me to reconsider. 


My wife is completely on my side and has told her mom to stop trying to smooth things over at my expense, but even she admitted she sorta wishes I’d just said yes to avoid the fallout.

,,,,,,,,popular,My best friend married the dumbest woman I have ever met and it's ruined our friendship,"They've been together since they were in high school, and I'm convinced he never thought he could do better, so he just dealt with it. He became a doctor, and they have two kids, and she makes all the decisions about their care.

She doesn't want them to go to school because she doesn't trust what they teach them. She's homeschooling them even though she failed her teaching certification 3 times and gave up on that career. Their kids have no vaccines. When I asked my best friend why he admitted, he just didn't want to have the fight with his wife even though he's vaccinated and a professional in the medical field. I lost most of my respect for him.

It makes me really sad. We've known each other since middle school, and dude is a shell of that super intelligent ambitious guy he was. I told them I couldn't trust them to be godparents to my daughter since we fundamentally disagreed with how they are raising their kids. 20+ years of friendship is pretty much gone now.

Edit for extra info since some people wanted to know more. His wife was in education, and I say was because she was fired from multiple jobs as a teacher for poor performance. Last job demoted her twice from teacher to aide to library assistant before they let her go. She never got her teaching license, which was part of the reason she got demoted. She couldn't pass the certification exams no matter how often she took them. The last count was at 3 before she gave up on the profession. 

They weren't always like this in our early 20s. She was big into fashion and cosmetics. Competed in a few local pageants. She went into teaching because her mom was a teacher. They moved to a semi rural area and she became super devout. This was new because they were never like this but whatever. That's when the home schooling started along with the anti-science/vaccines. Autism runs on his side of the family. His brother is high functioning and highly skilled in robotics. Her sister has an autistic child, blames vaccines even though autism also runs on her husband's side of the family.

They were our daughters' godparents, which would make them legal guardians if anything were to happen to us. I couldn't in good conscious keep them as guardians because if he won't advocate for his kids knowing what he knows he won't advocate for mine.

Edit 2: Seen the comment that godparents doesn't make them legal guardians and wanted to clarify. We grew up in the Caribbean and the term godparents/legal guardians is interchangeable for us.

Measles by itself is not highly lethal, but the danger it poses is serious for three reasons.

First, it is the most contagious disease known to humankind. The Spanish Flu had an infection rate of 1.5-2. Measles has an infection rate of 12-18.

Second, Measles can hide in the body for years, cross the blood-brain barrier, and cause death long after you forgot about it.

Third, the extreme danger of measles is what it does to your immune system. Throughout your life, as your body contracts and fights off diseases, it keeps a record of how to fight those diseases. Measles comes in and burns 20-70% of those records, so that the next time you catch a sniffle it might turn into a life-threatening lung infection.

I’m not talking about fancy gadgets or big-ticket items—just the little things that somehow make your day smoother, calmer, or a little more enjoyable.





For me, it was a $12 magnetic whiteboard I stuck to the fridge. Nothing fancy, but it became the central hub for my brain. Appointments, grocery needs, random thoughts—all of it lives there now. It’s helped my ADHD brain stay just a little more organized, and it’s saved me from forgetting things like my kid’s soccer practice or whether we’re out of milk.

Another one: a $6 scalp scrubber I got on a whim. I don’t know why it’s so satisfying, but every shower feels like a spa now. And I actually want to wash my hair more regularly, which is a win in my book.

I’ve heard people swear by things like cheap kitchen timers to stay focused, $10 milk frothers to elevate their morning coffee, or simple $5 silicone jar openers that save your wrists.

So I’m curious—what’s your small-but-mighty upgrade? What’s something under $25 that made your life better in a noticeable, lasting way?

Could be practical, luxurious, organizational, emotional—whatever works. Doesn’t matter if it’s boring or brilliant. I just love learning what everyday things people swear by.

,,,,,,,,popular,Fox Reporter Says the Trump White House Is Giving Wall Street Executives Inside Info on Tariff Negotiations,"Fox Business senior correspondent Charles Gasparino reported on Thursday that President Donald Trump’s administration is privately discussing trade tariff deals with Wall Street executives, sharing insights on their current status, which is information not being made public otherwise.

Citing “senior Wall Street execs with ties to the White House,” Gasparino wrote on X that people within Trump’s administration have held private discussions with business leaders about an “agreement in principle with India.” He further reported that the deal could be used as a template for other trade deals the administration is working on with Japan and other countries. Markets have taken sharp hits amid uncertainty surrounding Trump’s tariffs and trade deals.

,,,,,,,,popular,AITAH for playing a voice recording to prove to my friend her daughter isn’t nonverbal?,"So I (30f) have a friend (34f) that has a “non-verbal” daughter (3f) let’s call her Allie. I watch her 4 days out of the week in my in-home daycare.

 **I require contracts for every child and she never filled out the special needs section. And at no point when she asked me to take Allie did she mention any type of speech delay or non speaking issue..** 

Although Allie didn’t speak much at first (I figured she was shy) she communicated her needs to me very well and said small things to me frequently. Last month I was in the bathroom (I keep the door BARELY cracked with a wedge so I can listen for any dangers and they can’t walk in on me or see me) she walked by and said “Ew you stinky”. I laughed and told her mom at pickup what she said and I was met with “SHE ISNT VERBAL WHY WOULD YOU MOCK HER” I reassured her that Allie has spoken to me quite a few times and I thought that it was a huge milestone from when she first arrived and was barely saying anything. She told me she didn’t believe me and that it was messed up that I would make up something like that to upset her. I told her that I wasn’t trying to upset her but I wasn’t lying either. I didn’t press the issue further. 

Here’s where I might be the AH. I decided to record Allie (a voice recording, not her face) telling me her name and what her favorite animal is. 

** I had full intention of showing mom the recording, but I was scared at first because of her blowup at me and I didn’t know how she would react. After a few short pickups and drop offs she told me it was water under the bridge and that she didn’t want to talk about it anymore. She even insisted that I went to the birthday party. After that I was just happy Allie could continue and I ended up forgetting I had the recording at all. 

Fast forward to Friday (about a month later) she had a birthday party for her other child. At the party I was socializing with other family members (Honestly I’m a total dumbass for forgetting that her family fully thought that she was nonverbal) I mentioned the funny things Allie has said to me while we were reading an animal book. Turns out the person I was talking to was her sister and she started yelling at me saying “SHE IS NON-VERBAL WHY ARE YOU LYING”. Both her and her sister start berating me saying that it’s f*cked up that I’m making this up about Allie being verbal. At this point I’m tired of being called a liar. I have two disabled children whom my son was non-verbal for many years. I wouldn’t lie about something like this. So while everybody was staring at me I was scared and felt backed into a corner. So I (remembering I had the recording) decided to prove my case and play the voice recording. Everybody was shocked and my friend told me to leave. I told her I didn’t want to cause issues but I’m not gonna be berated and called a liar. She said that I crossed the line recording her daughter and that I’m an a**hole for embarrassing her at the party. Now I feel horrible and wondering if I should have just let it go..

Edit for clarification and extra context: 

Whenever she would pickup and drop off she wouldn’t ask me much other than “how was her nap, how much did she eat” and I would hand her the daily report then she would leave and not stay for small talk even when I would try to initiate.  
I know people have busy lives so I’m not gonna try to make them stay and talk to me about their life story. 

I also didn’t do the recording to embarrass her in any way. I didn’t mean any vindication by it. I can admit I should have shown her immediately after I recorded it but I’m also human and I was afraid of a second blow up. Then after her saying it was water under the bridge I was just happy that she wasn’t gonna take Allie away so I put it in the back of my mind and forgot about it. 

I feel bad about how I went about my defense (hence the post). I know it was unprofessional and unethical. I apologized profusely to everybody at the party and the family as well. 

I will be putting cameras in my home that everybody will have access to as well as updating all the contracts to let parents know what is going to happen going forward. Peace of mind for everybody sounds good to me! Also, I will be making a call to cps about the situation and see what they have to say.

Turned 34 on the 16th. Felt good, maybe even optimistic about this next chapter.
By the 18th, out of nowhere, my foot starts hurting. By the 21st? Fully swollen, can’t walk, pain so bad I was sweating through the sheets. ER says: Gout.
Like… isn’t that some medieval king disease? Cool cool.

Fast forward to last night. I’m laying in bed, just trying to sleep — finally — when a damn bug flies INTO MY EAR.
Not grazed it. Not buzzed near it.
IN. MY. EAR.
Deep.

I’m panicking, but trying to stay calm. My girlfriend’s next to me trying to help, but then she says, “OMG you’re bleeding!”
MA’AM THAT’S NOT CALMING ME DOWN.

Tried flushing it out with water. Warm water. Tilted head. Slapped the shit out of myself trying to get this thing out I did All the google DIY nonsense. Nope. Still feel it flapping around in there like it paid rent.

All urgent cares are closed, it’s like 1AM, so I go to the ER. Wait time? 4 hours. Nurse says, “you can just come back in the morning or try to go to urgent care after they open since im not in any pain (physical that  is)

So  I Go home. Bug’s probably dead now. My ear feels like a haunted cave.

Meanwhile, this is literally the first day I could fully put on my Crocs because of my gout foot.
I’m at work. Tired. Slightly traumatized. Slightly impressed I survived.

So yeah… Happy 34th to me.

,,,,,,,,popular,"AITAH for basically telling my in laws this is my house, if you don't like my rules get out.","First off I don't think I was wrong which has infuriated my girlfriend.

I (25) recently moved into my house. My girlfriend (27) and I had a little housewarming. Her family, my mother and a few of our friends.

We were eating outdoors and the kids had their own table. My girlfriend's nephew (8) knocked over a jug of dilute. I was at the table when it happened and it was clearly an accident. He was very polite and apologised. He was a little upset but I just laughed it off.

His father came over and I was shocked at how much his father gave out to him. I told him it was only an accident etc and he kept going.  I felt really guilty for not stopping it. He ran over to the corner of the garden and started crying.

His father went back to the table and he said what happened and his wife said he deserved that, he should stay there a long time or something along those lines. There was almost a snigger from some of her family.

Anyway I went over to the boy a couple of minutes later. I gave him a bar of chocolate. He was still crying. He said sorry again. I gave him a high five and taught him this high five I used to do as a kid.

His mother came over and said do you mind not talking to my son. He needs to think about what he did wrong and he needs to do that alone.

I took her and her husband aside and said this is my house, if you want to upset your kid dont do it here. If you don't like it get out. I swear the reaction that followed was insane. They went back to the table saying it. My mom said (never holding back) didn't I raise a great son. He's spot on not to let bullies in his house. Which erupted it even more.

My girlfriend spoke to me in private and asked me to apologise to them. I said no. I stand by what I said and (this part I regret a bit) I told her I think less of her for even asking me to apologise. A mate of mine and his son kicked ball with the boy and I. He actually gave me a hug (i dont do hugs) at the end of the party and said sorry again. He hugged so tightly for a couple of seconds. 

I really could go on about the drama but in short her family thought I was wrong. I was getting little digs etc. My girlfriend's friend came up privately and said I was right to step in.

My girlfriend is still pushing for me to apologise. I still don't think I did anything wrong. I didn't tell them how to parent but told them to leave if that's how they want to parent. If I'm being completely honest (i didnt say this), I'm not sure I'd want a kid with a family like that.

Honkai Star Rail:

* Mentioned that he wasn't very satisfied with what the team did with Amphoreus; the team's creative desire was too high, with many unnecessary designs.
* Elysia was designed by the former president of the NCTU Animation Club.
* Will check social media but not constantly, because there are many extreme voices; the data team can verify some community things.
* Our game rarely has clipping issues, which is supported by AI technology.
* After the 3.2 release, there was an internal meeting - originally they wanted to give a chance to see how the anniversary version content would perform, but in the end they still felt the version content wasn't good enough.

Some other Stuff:

* Made several investments when young, randomly invested purely out of personal interest, e.g., brain-computer interface, nuclear fusion, COMAC (Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China) - later didn't really manage these investments much.
* Particularly invested in brain-computer interfaces because a NCTU professor also wanted to start a business.
* The nuclear fusion project was done by an American-educated returnee classmate - with just one PowerPoint presentation, they conned Da Wei out of ""small goal,"" and then when they ran out of money, they conned him out of another ""small goal"" with another PowerPoint. (Note: ""a small goal"" is a Chinese meme referring to 100 million RMB).
* The Host: ""Jack Ma said having money doesn't bring happiness, so are you happy?"", Da Wei: ""Yes, I'm happy.""
* There was once a company that we didn't think could succeed at all, but they still managed to create their product and defeated us in 2019, that was Arknights.
* Metioned Sumeru in Genshin and the beginning of Zenless Zone Zero weren't great.

About campus recruitment:

* As the boss, doesn't know exactly how many people will be recruited this year, but miHoYo campus recruitment is really competitive - even Cai Miao (one of the original founders besides Da Wei) secretly participated in the written test but didn't pass.
* One person who applied for miHoYo campus recruitment knew more about miHoYo than all the interviewers, so they hired him directly.
* After many people were recruited, Da Wei sighed: ""Why would a great person like you want to end up in our company""

Client is already looking at us like, “This is who we’re paying?” So I step up, guide the presentation, cover for everyone’s blank stares, and even close the deal. Client’s happy, manager’s thrilled.

My teammates were not happy about it. Apparently, they claim I “showed them up” and “made them look unprofessional.” One of them even said I should’ve dressed down with them for “team unity.”

,,,,,,,,popular,Coworker found me on a dating app and won't let it go. What do I do?,"I am a female that works in a primarily male dominated field. I truly love my job, it's probably the best one I've had by far. Here's the coworker issue: one of my coworkers found me on a dating app. Well, he said his brother found me and asked him if he worked with me, due to my specification of the industry I worked in/my location. I wasn't working the day he made this discovery. Upon finding out I was on said dating app, he made it a point to let EVERYONE know I was. I found it odd. Why should he or anyone else care? I then realized it was in a ""damn she's desperate"" fashion. Not only is the workplace and field in general male dominated, but I am more than 20 years younger than the majority of my coworkers- with the exception of the guy who spread the info and a couple others. 

I didn't care initially, I presumed it would blow over; but it indeed has not. He and a few others bring it up in a mocking or teasing way quite regularly. It really wasn't funny the first time, and it definitely wasn't the second, third, or fourth time. I want to highlight that the intention does not feel playful, but instead is delivered in a very demeaning way. I will occasionally get unsolicited advice on my appearance from the same coworker.

I'm looking for advice on what I can do in this situation without turning it into an HR fiasco. I only plan to stay at this job until mid 2026. I want to make my next year enjoyable. What should I say next time he or another coworker brings it up? Something that will really embarrass them perhaps? Any advice is appreciated, thanks.

I (55 3/4 F) bought the house on my own in 2008. I paid the mortgage every week long before I got married, then as the primary/only breadwinner afterwards. And I'm both proud & relieved to be done.

Here's where the old person yelling comes in. Television trained me to believe that there would be some kind of document that I could burn to mark the milestone. There isn't (yet? Maybe I'll get some kind of doc from the bank in the mail?).

Instead, as I do all my banking online, and the payment comes out at the end of the day, I had to look at that $90 balance for days and days. Then this morning, I logged in hoping to see the account balance at zero. My plan was to screenshot it and send it to those in my life who'd celebrate with me, virtually. 

And yet... log in and the account was gone! Not zero, but disappeared. I'm happy it's gone, but I feel shafted on the celebratory experience. Any other GenXers let down by hitting this milestone without anything to bote it?

,,,,,,,,popular,AITAH for not selling my neighbor a thrifted rocking chair I JUST BOUGHT?,"I honestly have no words.  I (27)  just bought my house in july 2024.  We have learned that most of the neighbors are all old as hell.( i think these neighbors are 60s +) and are very nosey and onery that young families are moving into the neighborhood in recent years. They will just walk up to you and tell you this. 

I have been shopping thrift and estate sales to furnish this cute house. This morning, I came home from an estate sale with a BEAUTIFUL wingbacked rocking chair. (It needs to be reuplostered as the leather that was on it is in terrible condition and the previous owner started pulling it off. ) 

Im unloading it from the bed of my truck when neighbor , Carol,  sticks her giraffe neck over the fence and starts squawking about how beautiful it is . I said thanks i got it at an estate sale for $10! This triggered the parasites in her brain and she, i shit you not, teleported over to the truck. She starts going off about how much she needs a chair to rock her grandkids to sleep in and how much she would appreciate it if it was hers. I told her I got it for my future babies to be rocked to sleep in and that it still  needs lots of work before it can be used. Mind you this chair is large and she is very small. 

This is when she starts offering me money ($15 because "" its more than what you paid for it"") then telling me i dont need it because i dont have kids yet and her grandkids are only little for so long. After firmly telling her i wasn't interested in selling it, she offered me $20. 

I was standing in the bed of the truck looking down at her on the driveway and firmly said ""No, Carol im really not interested in selling this. Please go home."" And pointed to her side of the fence. Apparently this was shouting at her and being aggressive.  

She ran home and later in the day her husband said something to my husband as he was getting home from a game.  Telling him i (edit:"" spoke to her like a dog"" ) and was being  a ""nasty neighbor"" and that my husband needs to ""straighten me out.""  

Are my neighbors nuts? Was I that rude to her? 

(Edit I tried to attach a photo of the chair but i cant attach it on this community)

Edit : I meant no offense when I said "" old as hell"". I know that 60 is only half way through a life time.   I was trying to paint a caricature of who Carol and our other neighbors are. There is something really wrong with the folks in the cul-de-sac.

Guess how many people read it? One. Just myself.

On presentation day, I show up on time, dressing formal, fully prepped with notes. My teammates roll in 15 minutes late in jeans and hoodies, looking like they just woke up in the back of an Uber Eats order.

Client is already looking at us like, “This is who we’re paying?” So I step up, guide the presentation, cover for everyone’s blank stares, and even close the deal. Client’s happy, manager’s thrilled.

My teammates were not happy about it. Apparently, they claim I “showed them up” and “made them look unprofessional.” One of them even said I should’ve dressed down with them for “team unity.”

I'm sorry, next time should I just roll in wearing a bathrobe and hope for the best?

,,,,,,,,popular,AITAH for not allowing my husband to know the gender of our unborn child?,"I am currently 23 weeks pregnant with our second child. I don‘t know the gender yet and don‘t plan on finding out before birth. The problem is that my husband really wants to know before then, but I think he shouldn‘t. Since he works a lot, he rarely ever has time to come to the gyn appointments to see for himself and so far, I‘ve been telling the doctor that we don‘t wish to find out. We’ve been fighting over this and he thinks that it’s his right as a parent to know the gender and to be informed and up to date about everything. He says I should respect his wish and can’t decide this for him. 
My reasons for not wanting him to know are the following:
1. My husband wants a son. I know that for a fact, because he has made it clear in the past. We already have a daughter and even before her gender was confirmed, he had said that he wished for a boy. He is a good dad and loves his girl very much, but I’m pretty sure that the possibility of the next child also being a girl, is unsettling for him. Although he doesn’t admit it, he views having only daughters as some sort of failure and I really don’t like this attitude. I don’t want to enable and support this questionable behavior of him by having some big gender reveal.
2. I think it really doesn’t matter. The gender of a new baby should be the last concern on the parents mind and it’s something that can’t be influenced anyway. He says now that he also doesn’t care and just wants to know so he can “mentally prepare“. But there is no difference in preparing for a boy and a girl. All babies are are to be treated the same. They sleep and drink and fart, smile, babble and cry the same. To me it feels like he wants to “mentally prepare“ by being excited and happy about a boy, and by coming to terms with a girl. That really doesn’t sit right with me. Once the baby is here and healthy and growing, he has more than enough time to accept and adapt to whoever that child is gonna be. 
3. I don‘t think I can handle his disappointment in case it’s another girl. I am happy about this baby, I really am. We wanted another one and now that it’s happening, I just want to enjoy this journey in peace. Although I don’t care about the gender, I am afraid that him being disappointed would rub off on me in some way. It would definitely dull my excitement and I think that‘s neither fair to me nor the baby. Being hormonal and juggling a toddler and a pregnancy is exhausting enough and my mood swings quite a lot already. So I don’t think I’m stable enough to balance out his disappointment. 

So, my plan is for us to find out at birth. I believe that any disappointment over a possible girl is gonna be secondary once she is here and the joy and relief and exhaustion will be much more prominent. From the birth of our first child I know how excited and happy my husband was to hold a healthy child in his arms. He is very much a softy on the inside and I’m sure he’ll be smitten with this next baby as well.

He has a hard time finishing during sex, and he says it’s because I’m usually very wet, which reduces the sensation for him. He asked me to start doing Kegel exercises so that my vagina can “grip” him better. He’s also told me that he developed what’s known as “death grip” from watching porn and masturbating in a rough way for years, which desensitized him.

At first, I felt guilty. I started wondering if my body just wasn’t enough for him or if I wasn’t doing something right. I even looked up Kegel exercises and considered trying them for his sake. But recently, he brought it up again and told me to read posts on Reddit about how women can “tighten up.” or does kegel really works for it. When I told him I didn’t think it would change much, he got upset and said I was being dismissive. He claimed it was something I should do for both of us.

I told him the comment that i found on reddit about it, he didn’t like the responses he found online, he said, “It must be feminists writing that stuff,” which honestly rubbed me the wrong way. I got frustrated and told him, “This isn’t my problem. You’ve said yourself you have death grip from years of porn. So why are you putting it on me like I’m the issue? Maybe you’re the one who needs to do the work.”

He hung up the phone after that, and we haven’t talked since.

Now I’m wondering, AITAH for saying that? Was I too harsh for asking a break up towards this?

,,,,,,,,popular,I genuinely look forward to population decline and I’m tired of people saying it’s an issue,"I’m aware about the economics of it, and I’m sure bad things will happen. However, I think what it reveals is that our economic system as a whole is not sustainable. Even if the economy does shit, I couldn’t care less at this point. Pretty much everyday I mourn that I was born in the era with the highest human population ever. Even the most simple of resources suffer population pressures. How good the gdp is doing, or what the average salary is, or how the stock market is doing, has nothing to do with me as an individual. I see no reason to go out of my way to reproduce for the nation.  
  
I will only be happy if the strain on Earth is lessened. I hope someday that bison will roam the praries again, or that I’ll see wolves regularly in the mountains. Maybe it’s utopian, but there being fewer people is the first step. Thats all I would need to be happy, so anytime I hear about the declining birth rates, fewer people born, etc, I secretly become very optimistic.

,,,,,,,,popular,Als Marokkaanse deze subreddit moeten meemaken...,"Ik ben geboren en getogen in Nederland. Overal waar ik ga vragen ze me ""Je komt uit Amsterdam, he? Ik kan het horen."" Net als alle andere Nederlandse kindjes werd ik ook oud met het Sinterklaasjournaal in de winter, koninginnedag (ik zal nooit wennen aan koningsdag) in de lente, Hema softijsjes in de zomer en kastanjes zoeken in de herfst.

Exact hetzelfde geldt voor de Marokkaanse straatjochies op fatbikes. Toch is er altijd een verschil geweest tussen mij en die jongens: ik werd kansen gegeven, en hun niet. Op de basisschool zat de meester aan een aparte tafel om mij de stof van mijn Rekentijger boekje uit te leggen. Terwijl ik zat te leren over lichtjaren, cijfercodes en formules zag ik vanuit de hoeken van mijn ogen dat Ibrahim er ook naar snakte om dat kleurrijke rekenboekje in z'n handen te hebben.

Mijn moeder is net als ik hier opgegroeid. Ze vertelde me altijd dat ze veel moeite ervaarde als kind. Ze zat niet per se vast tussen haar Marokkaanse thuis en haar Nederlandse wereld, maar tussen de persoon die ze wilde worden en de persoon die de Nederlandse maatschappij haar toestond te zijn. Mijn moeder wou de atletiek in, maar die kans is ze niet gegeven omdat ze Mohamedaan is.

Ik moest aanzien hoe Ibrahim op de exact zelfde wijze werd behandeld als mijn moeder, en voelde me haast schuldig voor het hebben van dat Rekentijger boekje. Ik had toen besloten dat ik hem dat boekje elke vrijdag mee zou geven, zolang ik het maandag terug kreeg. Dit hebben we zo gedaan van M8 tot E8. Ik kwam hem vorige donderdag na 8 jaar tegen. Dankzij dat Rekentijger boekje had hij zijn passie voor wiskunde gevonden. Zijn school vond het MBO beter geschikt voor 'een jongen zoals hij'. Hij is omhoog geklommen van VMBO basis naar de universiteit, waar hij nu wiskunde studeert. In zijn vrije tijd geeft hij wiskunde bijles aan jochies zoals hem, die niet werden ondersteunt en aangemoedigd op de basisschool.

Het onderwijs gepaard met je afkomst is maar één van de vele factoren die samenhangen met kansenongelijkheid. Hoe meer van deze factoren je je eigen mag noemen, hoe groter deze ongelijkheid. Nu heb ik het geluk dat ik niet val onder veel van deze factoren, maar voor Marokkaanse jongens is dat anders. Verder is het zo dat jongeren met minder kansen sneller beland raken in criminaliteit, armoede of verslaving. Dit soort herrieschoppers zijn niks meer dan slachtoffer van kansenongelijkheid.

Als Marokkaanse heb ik erg veel moeite met de dingen die ik hier lees over de Marokkaanse gemeenschap, en met name over Marokkaanse jongens. Ik ben er ook slachtoffer van, nageroepen worden door deze jochies, maar als je je bewust wordt over hoe ze in deze toestand beland zijn geraakt, verandert jouw kijk op ze. Dit zijn jongens waar de Nederlandse maatschappij niet naar wilt of probeert te luisteren.

De racistische opmerkingen die ik keer op keer moet lezen scheuren mijn hart. Wij Marokkanen zijn overal: we zijn je huisarts, vuilnisman/-vrouw, advocaat, juffrouw, klusjesman/-vrouw, je buren en nog zoveel meer. Racisme lost niks op, en maakt het verbeteren van de toestand van deze jongeren nog moeilijker. Het is geen geval van 'slecht integreren' als het jongeren zijn die gewoon hier in Nederland zijn geboren en getogen. Ze zijn exact wat Nederland ze toestaat te zijn.

Het Centraal Bureau voor Statistiek - het CBS - is hier al een langere tijd van bewust, en er zijn ook initiatieven gevolgd hieruit. Zo zien we ook dat kinderen van buitenlandse afkomst vaker hogere school adviezen krijgen als hun kansen vergroot worden. Het eindeloze racisme moet maar is een keer stoppen. Niet alleen Marokkanen ervaren dit, maar ook Turken, Surinamers, Antillianen... Ik kan helaas doorgaan. Effectief focust een racist op het straatbeeld van zestien jarige jongetjes op een fatbike, en negeert daarbij de bijdrage die we hebben aan de Nederlandse samenleving.

Als Marokkaan, nee, als Nederlander met een buitenlandse afkomst is deze subreddit meemaken zeer teleurstellend. Ik merk dat comments als snel vol kunnen raken met haatzaaiend gedrag en/of foutieve informatie. Laten we elkaar netjes behandelen, en letten op de dingen die we zeggen 🫶🏼💛

,,,,,,,,all,Hey McDonald’s Employees Maliciously Complying with my Order… Thank You!,"This is a story of reverse malicious compliance or maybe anti-malicious compliance.

Back story: I’ve always loved ketchup. I use a lot of ketchup on my hamburgers. When I eat in at a McDonald’s that has a ketchup pump, I unwrap my hamburger and pump a quarter cup of ketchup onto the wrapper and dip each bite of my burger so it is drenched in ketchup.

Fast forward to today where the best way to get McDonald’s is to order in the app. As you can imagine, when I order my hamburger with the app, I always hit customize and select “extra ketchup”. Most of the time, the burger comes with an adequate amount of ketchup. It’s more than the regular amount and is fine.

Now queue what I imagine is malicious compliance! Sometimes when I order with my extra ketchup customization, I’ll open the hamburger and it looks like someone was murdered! Picking it up results in the insides starting to slide out because there is so much ketchup on the burger. I think to myself, “I bet this employee saw the extra ketchup customization and said you want extra, here is extra ha ha ha ha!” But boy do I love when that happens! I’m like now this is the way a burger should be!

,,,,,,,,popular,AITA for refusing to attend my sister’s wedding—or give a gift—after she invited my ex but excluded my wife?,"My (32F) sister (28F) is getting married in a few weeks. She recently sent out the official invites, and while I was included, my wife (30F) was not.

When I asked about it, my sister told me the decision was intentional. She said she wants her wedding to be “as peaceful as possible” and that she doesn’t feel comfortable having my wife there. For context: my wife and sister have never gotten along particularly well. There’s no major incident or explosive history—just mutual dislike and a few passive-aggressive exchanges over the years. That said, my wife has always been respectful at family gatherings, and I’ve never seen her act out.

What makes this worse, though, is that my ex-girlfriend (whom I dated for four years before meeting my wife) is invited. My sister remained friends with her after we broke up six years ago. I didn’t love it, but I never made an issue of it. Still, it’s incredibly hurtful to see that my sister would rather include someone from my past—someone I haven’t spoken to in years—over the person I’ve chosen to build a life with.

I told my sister that I wasn’t comfortable attending under these circumstances and that I wouldn’t be sending a wedding gift either. I said if she doesn’t recognize my wife as part of the family, then she shouldn’t expect me to play along with the celebration as if everything is fine. She accused me of being petty and trying to punish her for “setting boundaries.” My parents have since called to say I’m overreacting and that I should “just go and keep the peace.”

To me, this feels like more than a disagreement—it feels like a fundamental lack of respect for my marriage. But the family seems to think I’m making it about me.

AITA for refusing to attend the wedding and declining to give a gift because of how my wife has been treated?

,,,,,,,,popular,"My kid has a 4.0, killer SATs, did everything right and still got mostly rejected. What the hell happened?","Just lived through my first round of college admissions as a parent, and I’m still in mild shock. My kid’s got a near-perfect GPA, top percentile SATs, global upbringing, articulate essays, thoughtful recs, no discipline issues, no slacking, no silver spoon. Just a genuinely good, smart, hard-working human being who did all the things you're supposed to do.

And yet… rejection after rejection. Ghosted by most of the “brand name” schools. A few acceptances, some respectable, one private school came through with aid and a decent offer, but nothing like what I expected given how strong the profile was.

When we applied (Class of ‘00-ish), this would’ve been the type of student every admissions office drooled over. Now it feels like they barely looked.

I get that the game has changed, way more applicants, fewer spots, holistic this, institutional priorities that...but man. It’s brutal watching your kid play it straight and still get clobbered. They’ve handled it better than I have, to be honest.

Also weird to realize: I probably wouldn’t get into the schools I got into back then.

Oblivion is amazing, Skyrim is amazing, Morrowind is amazing. When will you all realise that each game has qualities that the others don’t?

Morrowinds story is superior to both but its gameplay is horrible. Oblivion has a great story but its bugs are terrible, like bad for a Bethesda game. I’ve had 5 quests break in the original and the remaster and without Reddit help I would have not been able to continue. The side quests and Daedric realms in oblivion are superior to both games. The enemy variety and design is also top notch. Skyrims combat is overall very good, outdated but better than the other elder scrolls. Skyrim had the better open world because it actually had tonnes of random encounters and in my opinion had better immersion. Its main story was bad but the DLCs were very good

Oblivion is amazing, the cities are something else and I love the game. I know the post isn’t really oblivion related mainly. But it will be my only post on this matter so don’t worry lol

,,,,,,,,all,AITA for refusing to split my inheritance with my stepbrother even though my dad “would’ve wanted it”?,"I (26F) recently inherited a decent sum of money from my dad, who passed away unexpectedly in January. I was his only biological child, and he never legally adopted my stepbrother (24M), who is my stepmom’s son from her first marriage. We’ve known each other since we were teenagers, and we’ve always been polite, but never close.

In my dad’s will, everything was left to me. He was very clear, even had a lawyer present when he went over it with me last year. My stepbrother wasn’t mentioned at all. I don’t know if that was intentional or an oversight, but the lawyer said the will was ironclad.

Now that the estate is settled, my stepmom reached out asking if I’d be willing to “do the right thing” and split the money with my stepbrother. I said no. She told me I was being cold and selfish, and that my dad “would’ve wanted” both of his kids to be taken care of.

That’s where I snapped a little. I told her that I am his kid. He never adopted her son, he didn’t include him in the will, and he definitely never treated us the same. When I got into college, he helped with tuition. When my stepbrother did, he said he “needed to learn responsibility.” It sucks, but that was their relationship, not mine to fix.

Now half of my extended family is calling me heartless, and even my boyfriend said he “gets why they’re upset.”

So, am I the asshole for keeping the money exactly how my dad left it?",3635.0,870.0,2025-05-04 16:50:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1keoepv/aita_for_refusing_to_split_my_inheritance_with_my/,2025-05-04 20:43:00.727855

,,,,,,,,popular,If you engage in crowd killing you are a coward and an embarrassment to the scene,"Just walked out of an Alpha wolf gig as the crowd killing was so especially egregious.
I m no stranger to moshpits. I have been going to metal, punk and hardcore gigs for 25 years and I ve seen all sorts of chaos in pits. It's fine. It's part of the scene, I get it - people get carried away with emotion and wanna cut loose and have fun. I m right there with you guys! 

But when Malevolence came on as the support for Alpha Wolf the crowd killing wankers came out to party the very second the first song started.
8 or 9 dickheads swinging windmill fists and body slamming everybody they can target. All pretty well built dudes too, safely swinging at anybody smaller than them. So naturally the entire crowd pulls back to make space. So now 8 dickheads have the entire floor to themselves while everybody else cowers on the periphery, too absorbed with evading punches and kicks to even watch the band they paid for.
Dickheads are getting bored swinging at each other and now specifically target the perimeter  with punches and body slams. A young girl gets body slammed hard and her boyfriend stands in front and pushes the crowdkiller away so what does the fuckwit do?! why he doubles down and body slams them again because he is big and she is small and what can anybody do?
The security watches on passively and uncaring.
Suddenly a guy a foot taller than me flies into me on purpose despite me being nowhere the mosh.
Then again purposely body slams me with elbows spilling my drink all over me.
Despite me clearly wanting no part in it he bashes me a third time.
So i give him a hard right hook to the rib cage and he limps away to cry to his friends. Once recovered he storms up to me and starts screaming in my face ""haven't you ever been to a gig before???!! Why aren't you okay with getting punched?!! Etc""
I try to explain to him that me quietly watching music isn't an excuse for him to repeatedly assault me.
He doesn't  like this and spends the rest of the next song abusing me like he is the victim, then sets off to find security.
So after punching countless people in the crowd and spilling their drinks and spouting verbal abuse he decides he is the victim and tries to get security to throw me out.

This is a crowd killer: pussy and coward. The second somebody stands up to them they cry like the bitches they are.
Security was about as useless as tits on a bull and wanders right past me and off into the sunset.
I walk out, demand a refund on the tour shirt I bought and drive home without even watching the main act that I drove 2 hours to see.

Fuck you - i dont support your shitty scene. 
Fuck Malevolence. Fuck alpha wolf. 
Fuck hardcore dance wankers.
If this is the kind of scene you are promoting you can keep your music and I ll keep my money. 

If I close my eyes and swing haymakers into my wife and call it dancing it's still assault - so why isn't it assault at a gig?!
How is it okay that a dozen wankers can ruin a gig for a thousand other people there?
These dickheads need to be treated like the pariahs and fuckwits they are and shown this shit is not acceptable.
End rant. 

EDIT: to those of you calling me a cunt for refunding a T shirt, think on this - why would I want to wear a tour shirt that represents the shittiest show I have ever been to? Furthermore, why would I support a band that let's this shit go on unchecked? They clearly don't care for their fans, so why should we care.

PS. This post has 1600 upvotes vs the dozen of you calling me a liar or a pussy. Think about that please, the majority of people don't support crowdkilling, no matter how cool you cringy vegan incels think it is. Fuck off and die now please.

,,,,,,,,popular,AITA for refusing to apologize for marrying and having children to the kids I put in foster care?,"I gave birth to my first kid when I was 13 and my second when I was 14. Neither of those pregnancies were my choice and I did not choose to carry to term. They were the result of a ""family friend"" getting to do whatever he wanted to me and my abusive parents refusing to let me abort. They talked about the pregnancies being punishments for trying to defy what their friend wanted from me. I had always been physically abused by my parents but once I was pregnant for the first time the abuse became a daily occurrence. 

I only got free a few months after my 18th birthday because parents were both arrested and what happened to me came to light. I told everyone who spoke to me that I did not want to raise the kids. There were attempts to help me keep them but even though I did what I could to keep them alive, I never bonded with them. I didn't have motherly love for them. I'd done the best with what I had but that wasn't good and I knew it even back then. Not only because of my lack of love or bond but I was also very messed up. So my kids went into the foster care system and I terminated my parental rights to them.

For another four or five years I lived pretty badly. I made dumb choices because of my traumas and I struggled to actually live the life I wanted. So much of everything was new to me and I didn't have a support system. I never even graduated high school. But eventually I got my life together. It wasn't easy and I have needed so much therapy. I still go to therapy. And I'm still a work in progress. I think given my past I always will be. But the person I am today is happier, healthier and I have the stability and support needed for a good life.

I married and had children with my husband in the last five years. Even though I technically had kids before I felt like a first time mom in many ways. There were a lot of firsts with my pregnancies and our kids.

Several months ago my older kids found me and reached out. They had questions which I did my best to answer but a lot of them I could not. I don't know medical history or all that much family history or info on their father. It was difficult and I spoke to my therapist a lot in that time. trying to explain how they came to exist was the worst part and I leaned on my therapist a lot to help me explain it without burdening them with my feelings. Even though both are technically adults now it wasn't an easy discussion. 

Through all of it I did have to be honest about not wanting a relationship. The younger kid accepted this. The oldest? They have reacted very differently. They feel I owe both a relationship and that it doesn't matter what I went through, that I am their mother and should act like it. There was also a demand that I apologize for marrying and having more kids when I let them grow up in foster care. I was told I was the adult in the family even at 13 and 14 and I should never have blamed them or denied them my life because of it. The oldest pushed on this so much that I had to block them. But I know this isn't either of their faults and I know there are people who can love their kids who were in my circumstances. The fact I didn't apologize has played on my mind. I'm not apologetic for what I did. But I still feel like I could be an asshole for that and for not doing it for the sake of the kid I gave birth to.

Well, few days ago my boss told me I can’t do that anymore. He said it “gives a bad image” in the workplace and could be seen as unprofessional. According to him, it’s for my own good—he literally said he wants to “protect me” from how others might perceive it in terms of company culture.

Then he added (and I’m not kidding): “If you want to play, go to a café or even the bathroom.”

I showed them my app receipt showing the correct store and proof of payment. Instead of helping, they told me to move forward or they’d call the police.

I parked and went inside to speak to the manager. I remained calm, showed her the receipt again and even logged into my bank account to show her the charge had gone through. She refused to give me my food and told me to “take it up with my bank.” She claimed giving me the food would be “giving away food for free.”

I asked if she understood how insane that was—me showing proof I paid, and still being refused. Her response? A shrug. No refund, no food, just gaslighting.

I left empty-handed and called my bank, where a kind customer service rep helped me dispute the charge. The contrast in professionalism was wild.

So when she asked me for $2,500 to buy her wedding dress, I didn’t hesitate. She was marrying my cousin, Jack, the guy she’d been with for years. They seemed perfect together.

Then came the bachelorette party.

Something felt off. Emily disappeared for hours, and when she came back, she was acting strange. Her other friends were visibly uncomfortable, but no one said anything. I didn’t pry, it wasn’t my business until I found out what happened..

A week before the wedding, a mutual friend told me that she saw Emily cheating on Jack with one of his friends at the bachelorette party. It wasn’t just a quick mistake, it was full on betrayal.

I couldn’t stay silent. I couldn’t let her get away with this, especially with a man who’d always loved and respected her.

Plus, Jack is family. I had to tell him. So I reached out to him. I told him everything, the details of what went down at the party. He needed to know the truth. He was crushed, but he deserved it.

The next day, Emily called me in a panic, crying and cursing. The wedding was off. 
Jack sent out a message to everyone, explaining what had happened. The wedding was canceled. Emily didn’t just lose Jack, she lost the respect of everyone who knew her. I know she won’t pay me back now.

My professor recently revealed that he’s been docking points any time he sees anyone with their cell phone out during the lecture–even if it's just lying on their desk and they’re not using it. He’s docked more than 20 points from me alone, and I don’t even text during lectures. I just keep my phone, face down, on my desk out of habit. It's late in the semester and I'm at risk of failing this class, having to pay thousands of dollars that I can’t afford for another semester, and lose the job I have lined up for when I graduate.

I talked to him and he just smiled and referred me to a single sentence buried in the five-page syllabus that says “cell phones should not be visible during lectures.” He’s never called attention to it, or said anything about the rule. He looked so smug, like he’d just won a court case instead of just screwing a random struggling college kid with a contrived loophole.  

So far I’ve (1) tried speaking to the professor, (2) tried submitting a complaint through my school’s grade appeal system. It was denied without explanation and there doesn’t seem to be a way to appeal, and (3) tried speaking with the department head, but he didn’t seem to care - literally just said “that’s why it’s important to read the syllabus.”  

I feel like I’m out of options and I don't know what to do.

**Some comments and replies for additional context**

\[Commentator\] He might just be trying to scare you and has no intention of actually deducting the points. Have you spoke to anyone that previously took his class?

OP:

>Yes actually. It came to light that this is a trap he pulls some semesters. Some people knew about it through word of mouth and were careful. I just didn't get the memo. Neither did a bunch of other kids in my class, and we're all in shock. He's serious about docking the points.

\[Commentator 2\] Did the syllabus even say anything about docking points for it?

>I looked. The syllabus says he retains discretion to adjust anyone's grade in light of any infraction.

>EDIT: to clarify, unfortunately the “infraction” is referring to having your phone out as well as a number of other things listed in the same paragraph (like not doing the readings, etc.). To me, it just read like a boiler plate paragraph in the middle of a long syllabus. I never thought he’d enforce it so rigidly and harshly, so I didn’t even register that just having my phone on my desk could have even been an “infraction”

[**UPDATE: April 26 2025**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1k8bh0g/update_professor_has_been_secretly_docking_points/) **Post was removed but recovered by DC**

I couldn't believe how much my original post blew up, and I implemented much of the advice I got. Now I'm at a crossroads.

**Background:** The original post is [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/s/uZGLCEo8N3) For those who didn’t see it, the TLDR is that my professor was secretly docking points from students any time their phone was visible during class, based on a single sentence buried in the syllabus. I just had my phone resting on my desk facedown (not using it) and he docked more than 20 points from me because it was ""visible."" The consensus here was to escalate the issue, and the advice I got was great.  Things were on track until yesterday. Here’s the update:

**Update:** After I read everyone’s feedback, I emailed the dean and the school newspaper. No response. I know that at least two other students in my class tried emailing the dean as well, without any luck. But I ran the math and I’m guaranteed to fail the class if the deductions stand. I have nothing to lose. 

So I wrote a petition. No one has taken this seriously coming from us individually, so I think it’s important to show that it’s not just a couple disgruntled college kids whining about a bad grade. My plan, if I can get signatures, is to send the petition to the dean and school newspaper.

I hit a small snag when I reached out to five classmates that I trust about signing the petition to get the ball rolling. They all thought it was a great idea …but didn’t feel comfortable being the first people to sign.  So to get around that, someone in the last thread suggested using a website (bopetition.com) that lets me make it so that signatures start out anonymous, but then un-anonymize when enough other people sign. That way no one has to be the “first” person to sign.

But here’s where I hit a major snag–yesterday, as I was getting ready to send the petition out, my professor sent us all an email attaching an “Amended Syllabus.”  The amended syllabus is exactly the same except now has a paragraph which says: “All grade disputes must be raised exclusively through \[grade appeal system\]. Any attempt to dispute a grade through alternative channels, including but not limited to direct outreach to faculty other than \[professor’s name\] will result in an automatic failing final grade of zero percent, without exception.”

Welp. I thought that was the end of it. No one would be interested in signing after that.

Surprisingly, three of the people I spoke with independently messaged me asking if I was still going through with the petition, and promised that they would sign if I did. They’re PISSED. They think this new policy is retaliatory. And then, three OTHER people I hadn’t even talked to about this reached out and said they heard that I was planning to send a petition, and would sign if I sent it.  They think a bunch of others would too. They wouldn’t tell me who they heard about the petition from, but the cats are out of the bag now. I'm not sure exactly how many others have had their grade docked because of the phone policy, but from asking around it seems like at least half the class had some kind of deduction.

Now I have to decide how to proceed in light of the update to the syllabus.  I’m considering going through with the petition, but having the app make it fully anonymous so we have some plausible deniability. The final result would only say that ## out of the 50 people in the class signed, but not who

\[Relevant Comment Chain\]

\[Commentator 1\] Okay so I’ve been teaching in higher ed for about 10 years now and it seems to me like this professor is trying to get out of actually doing his job? It’s unethical as hell to be playing with people’s lives and docking points without having been upfront about it. That’s just not the kind of thing I would ever do, but the biggest red flag for me is that we’re basically at the end of the semester which means he’s anticipating a bunch of people trying to dispute the grades at once. If he can give a bunch of you a failing grade because of a policy like this, he doesn’t have to sit down and actually do much grading then.

That’s the impression I’m getting, but I do also want to tell you that I didn’t see this as “whining”. GPAs can really affect your ability to engage in some forms of professional development. I got a bad grade in *one* class during my undergrad and my GPA never recovered. I had to explain why my GPA was under a 3.0 when I applied to grad school because of it so I have always taken grading really seriously. I’m sorry this jerk hasn’t.

\[Commentator 2\] OP has gotten dragged in every other sub they've posted in, so I'm glad another person in higher ed agrees with him. I've been teaching in higher ed FT for about 10 years, and been adjuncting or student teaching since 2006. In my experience, a policy like this absolutely would not fly, especially considering how vague the penalties were. Hell, we've been told not to even restrict technology in our classes because so many students have accommodations for note taking software, recording lectures, etc. Allowing a student to use their accommodations while no one else has them essentially outs them as having accommodations.

This new policy the professor is trying to implement is clearly retaliatory. I've seen professors disciplined over crap like this too. He's trying to make the students too afraid to question him and it's a complete abuse of his authority.

OP

>Thanks for this, lol. I was surprised by how rule and punishment oriented the college subs are.

,,,,,,,,popular,I paid $40 for McDonald’s. They “lost” my order and threatened to call the police.,"I placed a $40 order through the McDonald’s app, double-checked the location (1000 Eastern Blvd in Essex, MD), and paid in full. Pulled up to the drive-thru and gave them my code. They said they had no record of the order.

I showed them my app receipt showing the correct store and proof of payment. Instead of helping, they told me to move forward or they’d call the police.

I parked and went inside to speak to the manager. I remained calm, showed her the receipt again and even logged into my bank account to show her the charge had gone through. She refused to give me my food and told me to “take it up with my bank.” She claimed giving me the food would be “giving away food for free.”

I asked if she understood how insane that was—me showing proof I paid, and still being refused. Her response? A shrug. No refund, no food, just gaslighting.

I left empty-handed and called my bank, where a kind customer service rep helped me dispute the charge. The contrast in professionalism was wild.

Is this what passes for customer service now?
EDIT: Wow this really blew up. Thank you for all your support. Just FYI- I showed them my receipt, my order transaction from the app AND the bank transaction, somehow that wasn’t enough to prove I paid. Also I get the minimum wage, minimum effort issue. This was not that- at least it didn’t seem that way to me. It seemed like they were telling me that their “hands were tied” and that’s why they said they couldn’t help me. Wasn’t necessarily mad at the staff (maybe a little) but just mad at the so called “policy”.

,,,,,,,,popular,If you engage in crowd killing you are a coward and an embarrassment to the scene,"Just walked out of an Alpha wolf gig as the crowd killing was so especially egregious.
I m no stranger to moshpits. I have been going to metal, punk and hardcore gigs for 25 years and I ve seen all sorts of chaos in pits. It's fine. It's part of the scene, I get it - people get carried away with emotion and wanna cut loose and have fun. I m right there with you guys! 

But when Malevolence came on as the support for Alpha Wolf the crowd killing wankers came out to party the very second the first song started.
8 or 9 dickheads swinging windmill fists and slamming everybody they can target. All pretty well built dudes too, safely swinging at anybody smaller than them. So naturally the entire crowd pulls back to make space. So now 8 dickheads have the entire floor to themselves while everybody else cowers on the periphery, too absorbed with evading punches and kicks to even watch the band they paid for.
Dickheads are getting bored swinging at each other and now specifically target the perimeter  with punches and body slams. A young girl gets body slammed hard and her boyfriend stands in front and pushes the crowdkiller away so what does the fuckwit do?! why he doubles down and body slams them again because he is big and she is small and what can anybody do?
The security watches on passively and uncaring.
Suddenly a guy a foot taller than me flies into me on purpose despite me being nowhere the mosh.
Then again purposely body slams me with elbows spilling my drink all over me.
Despite me clearly wanting no part in it he bashes me a third time.
So i give him a hard right hook to the rib cage and he limps away to cry to his friends. Once recovered he storms up to me and starts screaming in my face ""haven't you ever been to a gig before???!! Why aren't you okay with getting punched?!! Etc""
I try to explain to him that me quietly watching music isn't an excuse for him to repeatedly assault me.
He doesn't  like this and spends the rest of the next song abusing me like he is the victim, then sets off to find security.
So after punching countless people in the crowd and spilling their drinks and spouting verbal abuse he decides he is the victim and tries to get security to throw me out.

This is a crowd killer: pussy and coward. The second somebody stands up to them they cry like the bitches they are.
Security was about as useless as tits on a bull and wanders right past me and off into the sunset.
I walk out, demand a refund on the tour shirt I bought and drive home without even watching the main act that I drove 2 hours to see.

Fuck you - i dont support your shitty scene. 
Fuck Malevolence. Fuck alpha wolf. 
Fuck hardcore dance wankers.
If this is the kind of scene you are promoting you can keep your music and I ll keep my money. 

If I close my eyes and swing haymakers into my wife and call it dancing it's still assault - so why isn't it assault at a gig?!
How is it okay that a dozen wankers can ruin a gig for a thousand other people there?
These dickheads need to be treated like the pariahs and fuckwits they are and shown this shit is not acceptable.
End rant. 

EDIT: to those of you calling me a cunt for refunding a T shirt, think on this - why would I want to wear a tour shirt that represents the shittiest show I have ever been to? Furthermore, why would I support a band that let's this shit go on unchecked? They clearly don't care for their fans, so why should we care.

PS. This post has 2000 upvotes vs the dozen of you calling me a liar or a pussy. Think about that please, the majority of people don't support crowdkilling, no matter how cool you cringy vegan incels think it is. Fuck off and die now please.

PPS I didn't think this post was gonna kick off so hard. Lot of angry little crowdkillers out there aren't there? 
To address you brain damaged idiots remarking ""if you don't like getting punched then don't go to the show..""
 I say this; I m going to start a club that smashes casual beach goers in the nuts with golf clubs and eye gouges every 12th McDonalds customer.
If you don't fucking like it don't go to the beach.
If you don't want to be eyegouged, then don't go to Maccas!

THIS IS WHAT YOU SOUND LIKE! 
The logic of somebody that has clearly taken too many blows to the head already. Cringe.

,,,,,,,,all,AITA For Stopping My Boyfriend’s Proposal at our Best Friend’s Wedding?,"
I (F26) and my boyfriend (M25) attended a mutual friend’s wedding. They’re very close friends to us and brought my boyfriend and I together. My boyfriend and I are coming up on our 3 year anniversary and things were getting pretty serious. Enough so that I very much wanted to marry him. He’s sweet, chatty, typically considerate and empathetic. He’s the person who I thought was the first to show me what a truly healthy and compassionate relationship was like. He’s very serious about us too. We’ve had long talks about marriage and it seemed we were in agreement with no formal declaration. We had even gotten as far as looking at rings. So the chance of a proposal was more of a “when” not “if.”

A few weeks before the wedding, us and the engaged couple at the time were hanging out. The topic of weddings was very prevalent and my boyfriend had cracked a joke about proposing at our friend’s wedding. The to-be-groom joked back and said “that’d be funny as hell.” This was followed by me and the to-be-bride both shutting it down; trying to be serious but also not thinking he was serious.

He was.

During the reception, everyone had made their speeches and people were getting their food. While our table was waiting, my boyfriend went up to the DJ, and after, they played my boyfriend and I’s favorite song to scream sing in the car together — Story of my Life by One Direction. I look at him, smiling and he’s looking around. All of a sudden he grabs a fork, stands up and begins clanging on a glass. Immediately the whole dining room looks over. I stand up and whisper the words “not. Right. Now.” 
His face drops and he yells a mix of “I’m sorry, I was just joking.” After he sat back down I verbatim said “let them have their moment, let’s make this our own.” He wouldn’t even look at me. When it was time to get our food he immediately goes toward the exit. I follow and tried to catch up to him but couldn’t find him. I text him twice and call him a couple times, but got no answer, so I went back to the reception.

After not hearing from him for about an hour and a half or so, he returns, sits down, and doesn’t even look at me. The rest of the night was terrible. He looked like his dog just died and I’m trying to make the best out of the night, but felt like I was just in his shadow. I was prepping for a breakdown or maybe a fight in the car, but the only thing he said was “I don’t want to talk about it right now.” And the drive was just quiet and awkward. 

He sent me a long text about how hard it was to get the ring, how he felt rejected by his closest person and that I embarrassed him.

I tried to explain that it’s not that I didn’t want to marry him. It was our best friend’s wedding and they deserve their moment. That we should create our own and not piggyback off theirs.
He got offended and said that if I wanted to marry him, I wouldn’t have stopped his proposal in front of everybody. 

This situation perplexes me. I’ve never seen the appeal of proposing at someone else’s wedding and tried to handle the situation in a way that I felt was calm and chill. But he’s very adamant that I ruined the proposal, made him look like an asshole, and thus im the asshole.
Am I missing something? Should I admit I was wrong and have just let his proposal go at our friend’s wedding?",3687.0,827.0,2025-05-05 03:03:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1kf1mqf/aita_for_stopping_my_boyfriends_proposal_at_our/,2025-05-04 20:55:16.118208

,,,,,,,,popular,AITA For Stopping My Boyfriend’s Proposal at our Best Friend’s Wedding?,"
I (F26) and my boyfriend (M25) attended a mutual friend’s wedding. They’re very close friends to us and brought my boyfriend and I together. My boyfriend and I are coming up on our 3 year anniversary and things were getting pretty serious. Enough so that I very much wanted to marry him. He’s sweet, chatty, typically considerate and empathetic. He’s the person who I thought was the first to show me what a truly healthy and compassionate relationship was like. He’s very serious about us too. We’ve had long talks about marriage and it seemed we were in agreement with no formal declaration. We had even gotten as far as looking at rings. So the chance of a proposal was more of a “when” not “if.”

A few weeks before the wedding, us and the engaged couple at the time were hanging out. The topic of weddings was very prevalent and my boyfriend had cracked a joke about proposing at our friend’s wedding. The to-be-groom joked back and said “that’d be funny as hell.” This was followed by me and the to-be-bride both shutting it down; trying to be serious but also not thinking he was serious.

He was.

During the reception, everyone had made their speeches and people were getting their food. While our table was waiting, my boyfriend went up to the DJ, and after, they played my boyfriend and I’s favorite song to scream sing in the car together — Story of my Life by One Direction. I look at him, smiling and he’s looking around. All of a sudden he grabs a fork, stands up and begins clanging on a glass. Immediately the whole dining room looks over. I stand up and whisper the words “not. Right. Now.” 
His face drops and he yells a mix of “I’m sorry, I was just joking.” After he sat back down I verbatim said “let them have their moment, let’s make this our own.” He wouldn’t even look at me. When it was time to get our food he immediately goes toward the exit. I follow and tried to catch up to him but couldn’t find him. I text him twice and call him a couple times, but got no answer, so I went back to the reception.

After not hearing from him for about an hour and a half or so, he returns, sits down, and doesn’t even look at me. The rest of the night was terrible. He looked like his dog just died and I’m trying to make the best out of the night, but felt like I was just in his shadow. I was prepping for a breakdown or maybe a fight in the car, but the only thing he said was “I don’t want to talk about it right now.” And the drive was just quiet and awkward. 

He sent me a long text about how hard it was to get the ring, how he felt rejected by his closest person and that I embarrassed him.

I tried to explain that it’s not that I didn’t want to marry him. It was our best friend’s wedding and they deserve their moment. That we should create our own and not piggyback off theirs.
He got offended and said that if I wanted to marry him, I wouldn’t have stopped his proposal in front of everybody. 

This situation perplexes me. I’ve never seen the appeal of proposing at someone else’s wedding and tried to handle the situation in a way that I felt was calm and chill. But he’s very adamant that I ruined the proposal, made him look like an asshole, and thus im the asshole.
Am I missing something? Should I admit I was wrong and have just let his proposal go at our friend’s wedding?",3687.0,827.0,2025-05-05 03:03:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1kf1mqf/aita_for_stopping_my_boyfriends_proposal_at_our/,2025-05-04 20:55:16.118208

,,,,,,,,popular,Hey McDonald’s Employees Maliciously Complying with my Order… Thank You!,"This is a story of reverse malicious compliance or maybe anti-malicious compliance.

Back story: I’ve always loved ketchup. I use a lot of ketchup on my hamburgers. When I eat in at a McDonald’s that has a ketchup pump, I unwrap my hamburger and pump a quarter cup of ketchup onto the wrapper and dip each bite of my burger so it is drenched in ketchup.

Fast forward to today where the best way to get McDonald’s is to order in the app. As you can imagine, when I order my hamburger with the app, I always hit customize and select “extra ketchup”. Most of the time, the burger comes with an adequate amount of ketchup. It’s more than the regular amount and is fine.

Now queue what I imagine is malicious compliance! Sometimes when I order with my extra ketchup customization, I’ll open the hamburger and it looks like someone was murdered! Picking it up results in the insides starting to slide out because there is so much ketchup on the burger. I think to myself, “I bet this employee saw the extra ketchup customization and said you want extra, here is extra ha ha ha ha!” But boy do I love when that happens! I’m like now this is the way a burger should be!

Thanks for the malicious compliance random McDonald’s Employees!",11328.0,800.0,2025-05-04 15:32:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/1kemkos/hey_mcdonalds_employees_maliciously_complying/,2025-05-04 20:55:16.118208

,,,,,,,,all,Real talk: playing Oblivion is increasing my support for the Empire in Skyrim,"When I first played Skyrim, it was my first elder scrolls game and I immediately supported the Stormcloaks due to the classic “rebellions against supposed fascism” cliche. 

However, after many playthroughs I became more of a sympathizer for the Empire as to prepare it for the next Great War. It was obvious the Thalmor wanted the Empire fragmented, so I believed playing into Ulfric’s hands would ultimately play into the Thalmor’s. 

Interestingly, after playing the Oblivion remaster, I noticed how noble, loyal and motivated the Empire’s soldiers and citizens are. 

While in Kvatch, three Imperial soldiers joined the fray because they saw smoke from the roadside. Every mounted legionnaire ensures you that if you run into trouble, to let them know. One of the palace guards told me he works to better the city and its denizens. Even the death of the Emperor had citizens from all over Tamriel in mourning. 

While I recognize the Empire in Skyrim (Mede) is not the same as the Septim Empire, it’s nice to see what *was* and how it could translate to what *could be*. 

Oblivion exemplifies what civilization has to offer under a unified society that further reinforces my decision for the civil war in Skyrim. 

Edit: also, shoutout to everyone on the Stormcloak side for providing their reasonings too. The discussion is much better with differing opinions as it helps me see both sides in a better light.

[**Professor has been secretly docking points anytime he sees someone’s phone out. Dozens of us are now at risk of failing just because we kept our phones on our desk, and I might lose the job I have lined up for when I graduate.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1jxjlxv/professor_has_been_secretly_docking_points/?share_id=KrL8hMQxtBBr33V0TKvA5&utm_content=1&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_source=share&utm_term=1) Also [posted to CollegeRant](https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeRant/comments/1k776tc/professor_has_been_secretly_docking_points/) **April 12 2025**

My professor recently revealed that he’s been docking points any time he sees anyone with their cell phone out during the lecture–even if it's just lying on their desk and they’re not using it. He’s docked more than 20 points from me alone, and I don’t even text during lectures. I just keep my phone, face down, on my desk out of habit. It's late in the semester and I'm at risk of failing this class, having to pay thousands of dollars that I can’t afford for another semester, and lose the job I have lined up for when I graduate.

I talked to him and he just smiled and referred me to a single sentence buried in the five-page syllabus that says “cell phones should not be visible during lectures.” He’s never called attention to it, or said anything about the rule. He looked so smug, like he’d just won a court case instead of just screwing a random struggling college kid with a contrived loophole.  

So far I’ve (1) tried speaking to the professor, (2) tried submitting a complaint through my school’s grade appeal system. It was denied without explanation and there doesn’t seem to be a way to appeal, and (3) tried speaking with the department head, but he didn’t seem to care - literally just said “that’s why it’s important to read the syllabus.”  

I feel like I’m out of options and I don't know what to do.

**Some comments and replies for additional context**

\[Commentator\] He might just be trying to scare you and has no intention of actually deducting the points. Have you spoke to anyone that previously took his class?

OP:

>Yes actually. It came to light that this is a trap he pulls some semesters. Some people knew about it through word of mouth and were careful. I just didn't get the memo. Neither did a bunch of other kids in my class, and we're all in shock. He's serious about docking the points.

\[Commentator 2\] Did the syllabus even say anything about docking points for it?

>I looked. The syllabus says he retains discretion to adjust anyone's grade in light of any infraction.

>EDIT: to clarify, unfortunately the “infraction” is referring to having your phone out as well as a number of other things listed in the same paragraph (like not doing the readings, etc.). To me, it just read like a boiler plate paragraph in the middle of a long syllabus. I never thought he’d enforce it so rigidly and harshly, so I didn’t even register that just having my phone on my desk could have even been an “infraction”

\[Commentator 3 in reply to a deleted comment\] Professor here. Nah, go see thr dean in person, and encourage others to go as well.

[**UPDATE: April 26 2025**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1k8bh0g/update_professor_has_been_secretly_docking_points/) **Post was removed but recovered by DC**

I couldn't believe how much my original post blew up, and I implemented much of the advice I got. Now I'm at a crossroads.

**Background:** The original post is [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/s/uZGLCEo8N3) For those who didn’t see it, the TLDR is that my professor was secretly docking points from students any time their phone was visible during class, based on a single sentence buried in the syllabus. I just had my phone resting on my desk facedown (not using it) and he docked more than 20 points from me because it was ""visible."" The consensus here was to escalate the issue, and the advice I got was great.  Things were on track until yesterday. Here’s the update:

**Update:** After I read everyone’s feedback, I emailed the dean and the school newspaper. No response. I know that at least two other students in my class tried emailing the dean as well, without any luck. But I ran the math and I’m guaranteed to fail the class if the deductions stand. I have nothing to lose. 

So I wrote a petition. No one has taken this seriously coming from us individually, so I think it’s important to show that it’s not just a couple disgruntled college kids whining about a bad grade. My plan, if I can get signatures, is to send the petition to the dean and school newspaper.

I hit a small snag when I reached out to five classmates that I trust about signing the petition to get the ball rolling. They all thought it was a great idea …but didn’t feel comfortable being the first people to sign.  So to get around that, someone in the last thread suggested using a website (bopetition.com) that lets me make it so that signatures start out anonymous, but then un-anonymize when enough other people sign. That way no one has to be the “first” person to sign.

But here’s where I hit a major snag–yesterday, as I was getting ready to send the petition out, my professor sent us all an email attaching an “Amended Syllabus.”  The amended syllabus is exactly the same except now has a paragraph which says: “All grade disputes must be raised exclusively through \[grade appeal system\]. Any attempt to dispute a grade through alternative channels, including but not limited to direct outreach to faculty other than \[professor’s name\] will result in an automatic failing final grade of zero percent, without exception.”

Welp. I thought that was the end of it. No one would be interested in signing after that.

Surprisingly, three of the people I spoke with independently messaged me asking if I was still going through with the petition, and promised that they would sign if I did. They’re PISSED. They think this new policy is retaliatory. And then, three OTHER people I hadn’t even talked to about this reached out and said they heard that I was planning to send a petition, and would sign if I sent it.  They think a bunch of others would too. They wouldn’t tell me who they heard about the petition from, but the cats are out of the bag now. I'm not sure exactly how many others have had their grade docked because of the phone policy, but from asking around it seems like at least half the class had some kind of deduction.

Now I have to decide how to proceed in light of the update to the syllabus.  I’m considering going through with the petition, but having the app make it fully anonymous so we have some plausible deniability. The final result would only say that ## out of the 50 people in the class signed, but not who

\[Relevant Comment Chain\]

\[Commentator 1\] Okay so I’ve been teaching in higher ed for about 10 years now and it seems to me like this professor is trying to get out of actually doing his job? It’s unethical as hell to be playing with people’s lives and docking points without having been upfront about it. That’s just not the kind of thing I would ever do, but the biggest red flag for me is that we’re basically at the end of the semester which means he’s anticipating a bunch of people trying to dispute the grades at once. If he can give a bunch of you a failing grade because of a policy like this, he doesn’t have to sit down and actually do much grading then.

That’s the impression I’m getting, but I do also want to tell you that I didn’t see this as “whining”. GPAs can really affect your ability to engage in some forms of professional development. I got a bad grade in *one* class during my undergrad and my GPA never recovered. I had to explain why my GPA was under a 3.0 when I applied to grad school because of it so I have always taken grading really seriously. I’m sorry this jerk hasn’t.

\[Commentator 2\] OP has gotten dragged in every other sub they've posted in, so I'm glad another person in higher ed agrees with him. I've been teaching in higher ed FT for about 10 years, and been adjuncting or student teaching since 2006. In my experience, a policy like this absolutely would not fly, especially considering how vague the penalties were. Hell, we've been told not to even restrict technology in our classes because so many students have accommodations for note taking software, recording lectures, etc. Allowing a student to use their accommodations while no one else has them essentially outs them as having accommodations.

This new policy the professor is trying to implement is clearly retaliatory. I've seen professors disciplined over crap like this too. He's trying to make the students too afraid to question him and it's a complete abuse of his authority.

OP

,,,,,,,,popular,Did I really break wedding etiquette?,"Throwaway account to try to stay as anonymous as possible (though the incident is probably too specific).

About a year ago my (41F) sister (33F) sent out her save the dates.  She was getting married less than a week before my son's 18th birthday.  Since my family is all over the country, my son has never had a big birthday celebration.  My sister was planning a post-wedding brunch the day after the ceremony/reception and I asked if she would be ok if we could do something for my son in the afternoon since family will already be gathered for her wedding.  She loved the idea and I ran it by my son (and reminded him he can do something with his friends on his actual birthday).  Both were happy with the idea.  I even chose a venue away from the hotel we'd all be staying at so my sister wouldn't feel we were encroaching on her wedding.

All good so far, no problems.

Six months ago the invitations came and I RSVPed for me and my son (ex husband is not in the picture).  Meal options were a beef dish or a fish dish.  I RSVPed for 2 beef dinners.

Now on to the problem and where I'm being told I'm in the wrong.  At the reception yesterday, my almost 18 year old son was given a child's meal (chicken nuggets and steak fries).  I told the server there was a mistake and we RSVPed for the beef dish.  The server took the plate and brought out a beef dinner two minutes later.

For clarification, this wasn't a child-free wedding and there were about 5 kids there, aged 4-9 or so.

At the brunch today my sister pretty much ignored me and was really cold when she did talk to me. As it was ending I asked if she was still coming to my son's celebration since she seemed like she was mad at me.  She pulled out a piece of paper and said, ""Maybe I'll come once you pay this.""  The paper was an invoice she made up for $77.50 for an extra dinner. 

I was confused and asked her what it was about and apparently my nearly 18 year old son was supposed to get a child's meal and the caterer was charging my sister an additional $77.50 and that it was my fault they had to provide an additional meal.

I told her that 1) I had RSVPed and chosen the adult meal for him months ago and 2) he's a 17 year old - how would anyone think a meal of 4 chicken nuggets and a handful of fries would be enough for him?

It became this big blow up and my sister turned it into people having to take sides.  And surprise - my son's birthday party ended up being a disaster that almost no one attended because ""your sister is the bride and she makes the rules on her day.""  Even our mom skipped it because my sister was ""inconsolable."" Everyone is telling me he should have just sucked it up and I could have taken him to McDonald's afterwards.  I still think I'm being perfectly reasonable.

,,,,,,,,all,The world that demands 24/7 work needs to accommodate night shift workers,"I work from 11pm to 7am or 11am in a factory five to seven days a week, therefore I sleep most of the day. Most everything closes between 6pm and 8pm except for a few fast food restaurants that close at 11 and the all night gas stations. I can rarely get in a good day of shopping for essentials and even more rarely get appointments for things like the doctor or dentist. It seems like doctors and dentists offices close even earlier than everything else. I also work for state minimum wage so I can't afford to get things delivered. It got so bad I couldn't refill a needed medication and ended up in the ER just because I couldn't find a doctor in my network to take me after 3pm

In a world where there will ALWAYS be jobs that take place at night, there needs to be places OPEN at night so I don't screw up my sleep schedule and end up falling asleep at the line just because I needed to go to Walmart to pick up groceries and didn't want to be rushing between home, the shops, and work.

There is also a huge problem around the stigma of sleeping while the sun is out. I'm not lazy, I'm on my feet all night and should be allowed to sleep until my next shift. 

Edit: I am NOT advocating for everything to be open 24/7 all the time, I'm asking for more grace towards night shift and things that open earlier or later. I don't want to come home covered in grease and sweat and immediately go to the doctors or sit around for hours waiting for things to open. I'd love it if I could get an appointment at 5 but I can't because that's the time most healthcare places close around me. I'm honestly just begging for places to close at 9 or 10 instead of between 5 and 8. I'm not asking for the world to revolve around the third shift and night owls in general, I'm just on my knees begging to be treated like a human and not a work horse who's only job is to work, sleep, and then work again. I'd like free time to go do things without watching the clock or breaking my sleep schedule to be up earlier.",1640.0,210.0,2025-05-05 10:02:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/1kf7uxt/the_world_that_demands_247_work_needs_to/,2025-05-05 10:51:22.940037

Instead, the Amazon version shows a blank page for 20 seconds or so.

""Oh I just ChatGPT it.""

I'm sorry, but what about this AI/LLM/word salad generating machine is so irresitably attractive and ""accurate"" that almost everyone I know insists on using it for information?

I get that Google isn't any better, with the recent amount of AI garbage that has been flooding it and it's crappy ""AI overview"" which does nothing to help. But come on, Google exists for a reason. When you don't know something you just Google it and you get your result, maybe after using some tricks to get rid of all the AI results.

Why are so many people around me deciding to put the information they received up to a dice roll? Are they aware that ChatGPT only ""predicts"" what the next word might be? Hell, I had someone straight up told me ""I didn't know about your scholarship so I asked ChatGPT"". I was genuinely on the verge of internally crying. There is a whole website to show for it, and it takes 5 seconds to find and another maybe 1 minute to look through. But no, you asked a fucking dice roller for your information, and it wasn't even concrete information. Half the shit inside was purely ""it might give you XYZ""

I'm so sick and tired about this. Genuinely it feels like ChatGPT is a fucking drug that people constantly insist on using over and over. ""Just ChatGPT it!"" ""I just ChatGPT it."" You are fucking addicted, I am sorry. I am not touching that fucking AI for any information with a 10 foot pole, and sticking to normal Google, Wikipedia, and yknow, websites that give the actual fucking information rather than pulling words out of their ass \[""learning"" as they call it\].

So sick and tired of this. Please, just use Google. Stop fucking letting AI give you info that's not guaranteed to be correct. ",928.0,562.0,2025-05-05 08:38:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1kf6ohc/what_is_the_obsession_with_chatgpt_nowadays/,2025-05-05 10:53:31.143320

,,,,,,,,all,"Hell, even Netflix has tariffs.","American media stocks tumbled on Monday after President Donald Trump unveiled a 100% tariff on all movies produced outside the U.S., in his latest levies that could sharply raise costs for Hollywood studios and roil the global entertainment industry.

Trump's announcement was light on details. It did not say whether the duties will target films on streaming platforms and those shown in theaters, nor did it specify if the tariffs will be calculated based on production costs or box office revenue.

Streaming pioneer Netflix could particularly be at risk, as it relies on its global production network to produce content for international audiences. Its shares slumped 4.9% in premarket trading, leading a slide in media stocks.

,,,,,,,,popular,AITA for refusing to let my boyfriend move in after only three months of dating?,"I (32F) have been dating my boyfriend Ryan (35M) for a little over three months. Things have been going well—we see each other a few times a week, enjoy each other’s company, and have been gradually getting to know each other.

About two weeks ago, Ryan brought up the idea of moving in together. I was surprised. Three months feels way too soon for something that big, especially considering I’ve lived alone for the past five years and really value my personal space. I told him as gently as I could that I wasn’t ready for that kind of commitment yet and wanted to continue building our relationship slowly.

He didn’t take it well. He said I was “putting up walls” and that “if I knew he was the one, I wouldn’t hesitate.” He also mentioned that his lease is ending soon and moving in with me would help him save money. That part made me uncomfortable—like this was less about love and more about convenience.

Since then, he’s been distant and keeps bringing it up in passive-aggressive ways. He even joked to my friends that I’m “keeping him at arm’s length” and “treating him like a guest.” Some of them think I’m being too cautious and should give it a try, but I’ve seen enough rushed relationships crash and burn to know better.

I’m starting to question myself, though. Am I being too guarded, or is three months just too soon?

,,,,,,,,all,YSK The U.S. Department of Education is collecting on student loans again. Know your rights as a person in debt.,"Why YSK: It could save you thousands and protect your future.

On May 5, the U.S. Department of Education will commence collecting on student loans after a five-year hiatus. This is going to throw thousands of American lives into chaos, and you should know what your rights are when dealing with collection agencies.

**U.S. Department of Education to Begin Federal Student Loan Collections, Other Actions to Help Borrowers Get Back into Repayment**  
[https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/us-department-of-education-begin-federal-student-loan-collections-other-actions-help-borrowers-get-back-repayment](https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/us-department-of-education-begin-federal-student-loan-collections-other-actions-help-borrowers-get-back-repayment)

For starters, this is not legal advice. From 2005 – 2007, I was a collections agent for California Student Aid Commission (CSAC) working at a third-party collection’s agency. A lot has likely changed between that date and today, and I invite anyone with more information to contribute in the comments below.

**1. Know your rights as a U.S. citizen in debt**

Begin by reviewing the “Fair Debt Collection Practices Act” found at the Federal Trade Commission site here:

[https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/rules/fair-debt-collection-practices-act-text](https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/rules/fair-debt-collection-practices-act-text)

This is every collector’s boogey-man. Breaking these rules can result in the person in debt (debtor) suing the collection’s agent, agency, etc. into having the loan waived and damages paid out.

Pay particular attention to section 805 and 806, which outline the way they can communicate with you and what is considered harassment.

**2. Know what repayment options you have available to you**

You can find information on repayment at the Federal Student Aid website here:

[https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/repayment/repaying-101](https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/repayment/repaying-101)

There are always options for repayment. I’m not saying that all are realistic to your experience, but do not hide your head in the sand.

I couldn’t find information on what default payment plan options there are, but from my experience in 2005-2007, there were more (and better) options for repayment for those in default.

At the time, the two main solutions were: consolidation with the Department of Education and a Rehabilitation plan. If anyone is still actively collecting, or recently out of the job, please comment on whether these still exist.

Rehabilitation, if possible, is your best path forward. It was a nine-month program, with an admittedly high monthly payment, that would put your loan back into good standing and repair the credit hit you received from falling into default.

**3. Making voluntary payments, even small ones, helps**

I know that when we are in debt that every penny counts. However, as the news has probably already alerted you (and hopefully reading your contract at the time of signing), the government can and will garnish your wages/social security. There is no way to escape it.

Therefore, if you can, sending $25 a month on the balance can help to stave off the government’s ability to garnish you. By making a best faith effort to repay, it complicates involuntary collection activities.

Additionally, it is helpful to keep the ever-increasing interest at bay and can help prevent the loan from bouncing across offices.

**4. Understand what is happening to your loan**

If your loan has fallen into default, it is important that you understand what is going to happen with it because it impacts who you pay, and how much you will have to pay at the end of the day.

When a loan is in default, it is packaged into a portfolio of other defaulted loans. For example, let’s say a portfolio is built with 100 people’s defaulted student loans. This portfolio is then bid on by third party agencies that specialize in debt collection.

Once the loan has been transferred from the government, it is dinged with a collection charge. I can’t remember the exact phrase, or amount, but it was something around 2.5% of your loan balance. That means if your loan was $25,000 at the time it went into default it was now $25,625 the moment it arrives at the third-party collection’s agency.

You then get interest hits on the daily balance from there. I’m not sure what the specific percentage is, but most people I eventually talked with were floored with what they thought was $25,000 now being $45,000 after years of failed payment.

That’s not the end, though. If the first collection’s agency fails to collect on the balance, the portfolio can be shopped around to other agencies. Then, that initial collection’s charge gets tacked onto the balance at the time it leaves that office. Therefore, if it was $45,000 at the time it left my office to go to another the balance would be $46,125 the moment it arrives at the next.

**Conclusion**

I hope those with more information can help to correct anything I said or provide insight into more recent collection practices. I’m also happy to answer anything I can based upon my past.",2329.0,154.0,2025-05-05 16:02:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/1kffaqc/ysk_the_us_department_of_education_is_collecting/,2025-05-05 11:03:59.183149

,,,,,,,,popular,I feel like the US is going to fall apart in our lifetimes. Anybody else?,"We’ve already seen so much civil unrest. We might as well be called the Divided States of America. I wholeheartedly believe if other countries that we’ve alienated joined forces to invade us, there would not be enough public support to save the entire US. Either that or a second civil war would start that’s bloodier than the first. Maybe the states will fracture into smaller countries.

And this kind of unrest has been going on since the Cold War/Vietnam era, maybe longer, and only getting worse. I know so many people that hate it here, you know? We pay taxes but barely get any benefits, the healthcare system is shit, late-stage capitalism has sent everyone except a select few to the working class, and now we’re facing a recession during record-breaking inflation. Not to mention the price gouging of all the essentials (rent, groceries, gas). And don’t even get me started on the quality of food and the prevalence of fast food. Everyone is realizing the system is rigged to make us poor and sick. How long can something like that last until people say enough is enough? It seems like people, especially educated people, are waking up from the so-called American Dream.

Edit: it doesn’t matter how big our military is if there is internal strife and splintering. Also, people have to want to fight for the country, and public sentiment is falling. Think about the Roman Empire guys. They were defensible until they split apart. That’s what I’m saying seems to be happening here. Use some critical thinking guys.

,,,,,,,,popular,My progressive boyfriend „told me a joke“ recently,"So I want to start out saying that my bf is the absolute best person in the world, he cookes, cleans, dies laundry, like everything (more often than I do because I have quite a demanding job). Now recently out of nowhere he made a joke about how women are inferior to men. He said something of this sense: ugh women make things just worse for society. And I was kinda taken aback, because that’s the first time I‘ve heard him say something like that and I reprimanded him. I didn’t like him saying such things. Then he told me that he was just joking and I answered that jokes are supposed to be funny. Then he said something that made me furious: Well you just can’t take a joke because you hate being your gender. Like??? What the hell?? I asked him to elaborate, because I work in a very male dominated sector and come home very late while he is working from home the entire day. Then later that day he made a similar „joke“, I snapped, and he promised to never joke like that again. 

What is happening? I‘ve never had any problems like this before with him? Is it the media he consumes that makes him say that bullshit? He has always beeb very, actually the most, progressive man I have ever met, that’s why we even became a couple. Now I don’t know anymore… I feel like this is the first sign of incel behaviour and I don’t want to marry such a man. Am I just overthinking this?? 

TL;DR: My feminist bf made an unfunny and frankly sexist „joke“ and told me I don’t find it funny because I hate being a woman.

Edit: I totally didn’t expect anyone to read this post so I‘m really thankful for all your perspectives and support.

Trump's announcement was light on details. It did not say whether the duties will target films on streaming platforms and those shown in theaters, nor did it specify if the tariffs will be calculated based on production costs or box office revenue.

Streaming pioneer Netflix could particularly be at risk, as it relies on its global production network to produce content for international audiences. Its shares slumped 4.9% in premarket trading, leading a slide in media stocks.

,,,,,,,,all,My boss wanted us to be “exactly on time” so I stopped showing up early. Guess what? She hated it,"I work at a digital marketing company that *thinks* it’s Google but without any of the perks. No snacks, no flexibility, no fun office culture. What we *do* have is Laura.

Laura is our new team lead. She’s 29, has a master’s degree in “leadership” from some overpriced private school with a Latin motto and absolutely no real-world application. She showed up on day one with color-coded notebooks, a laminated daily affirmation on her desk, and the energy of someone who thinks “Girlbossing” is a personality trait. She uses phrases like “vertical synergy,” “unlocking cross-functional efficiency,” and “aligning KPIs with the 360 vision” completely unironically.

The day she started, she came to introduce herself and didn’t bring much, just a suitcase and [this under her arm. It wasn’t like ‘I’m going to read while I have my coffee,’ it was more like a statement of intent, like, look at the kind of things I read, I’m a leader.](https://aitah.click/nmt2cs)

Anyway, last week she sent out an email to the whole team that said, and I quote:

**“I’ve noticed people getting a little too relaxed with start times. Beginning Monday, I expect everyone to be at their desks AT 9:00 AM SHARP. Not earlier. Not later. Thanks 😊.”**

Not earlier *or* later? Say less.

Normally, I’d get to work around 8:45. I’d grab a coffee, chat with coworkers, go through my emails calmly. But hey, if 9:00 on the dot is what she wants, that’s what she’ll get.

So Monday rolls around, and I walk into the building at 8:59. I scan my badge at 9:00, power walk to my desk, open my laptop at 9:01. By 9:03, Laura pings me on Teams:  
“Hey, everything okay? Saw you rushing in at 9.”

I replied with a screenshot of her own email. No response.

This went on all week. Every day I arrived at 9:00 *exactly*. Coffee in hand, sometimes still wearing my jacket, looking like I just rolled out of bed (because I did). Slowly, the rest of the team caught on and started doing the same. Nobody showed up early. At all.

It got weirdly synchronized. Like we were part of a corporate flash mob.

On Tuesday she scheduled a daily standup for 8:55. No one joined. At 9:00, we all appeared like clockwork.

By Friday, another email hit our inboxes:  
**“Thanks for the punctuality this week. Starting Monday, feel free to manage your time as you see fit, as long as your work is getting done. I trust you all ❤️.”**

And just like that, we went back to showing up a little early, with warm coffee and zero passive-aggressive micromanagement.

Thanks for your leadership, Laura.",1974.0,75.0,2025-05-05 18:10:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/1kfijt9/my_boss_wanted_us_to_be_exactly_on_time_so_i/,2025-05-05 18:40:12.820052

But with how cruel and inhumane trump’s right wing minions are running our country, I don’t know how anyone can pretend the left is equally as evil.

Now that we see what happens when republicans have the majority of the power of our government, it’s blatantly clear how the right is owned by the rich to exploit the masses.

,,,,,,,,popular,YSK The U.S. Department of Education is collecting on student loans again. Know your rights as a person in debt.,"Why YSK: It could save you thousands and protect your future.

On May 5, the U.S. Department of Education will commence collecting on student loans after a five-year hiatus. This is going to throw thousands of American lives into chaos, and you should know what your rights are when dealing with collection agencies.

**U.S. Department of Education to Begin Federal Student Loan Collections, Other Actions to Help Borrowers Get Back into Repayment**  
[https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/us-department-of-education-begin-federal-student-loan-collections-other-actions-help-borrowers-get-back-repayment](https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/us-department-of-education-begin-federal-student-loan-collections-other-actions-help-borrowers-get-back-repayment)

For starters, this is not legal advice. From 2005 – 2007, I was a collections agent for California Student Aid Commission (CSAC) working at a third-party collection’s agency. A lot has likely changed between that date and today, and I invite anyone with more information to contribute in the comments below.

**1. Know your rights as a U.S. citizen in debt**

Begin by reviewing the “Fair Debt Collection Practices Act” found at the Federal Trade Commission site here:

[https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/rules/fair-debt-collection-practices-act-text](https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/rules/fair-debt-collection-practices-act-text)

This is every collector’s boogey-man. Breaking these rules can result in the person in debt (debtor) suing the collection’s agent, agency, etc. into having the loan waived and damages paid out.

Pay particular attention to section 805 and 806, which outline the way they can communicate with you and what is considered harassment.

**2. Know what repayment options you have available to you**

You can find information on repayment at the Federal Student Aid website here:

[https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/repayment/repaying-101](https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/repayment/repaying-101)

There are always options for repayment. I’m not saying that all are realistic to your experience, but do not hide your head in the sand.

I couldn’t find information on what default payment plan options there are, but from my experience in 2005-2007, there were more (and better) options for repayment for those in default.

At the time, the two main solutions were: consolidation with the Department of Education and a Rehabilitation plan. If anyone is still actively collecting, or recently out of the job, please comment on whether these still exist.

Rehabilitation, if possible, is your best path forward. It was a nine-month program, with an admittedly high monthly payment, that would put your loan back into good standing and repair the credit hit you received from falling into default.

**3. Making voluntary payments, even small ones, helps**

I know that when we are in debt that every penny counts. However, as the news has probably already alerted you (and hopefully reading your contract at the time of signing), the government can and will garnish your wages/social security. There is no way to escape it.

Therefore, if you can, sending $25 a month on the balance can help to stave off the government’s ability to garnish you. By making a best faith effort to repay, it complicates involuntary collection activities.

Additionally, it is helpful to keep the ever-increasing interest at bay and can help prevent the loan from bouncing across offices.

**4. Understand what is happening to your loan**

If your loan has fallen into default, it is important that you understand what is going to happen with it because it impacts who you pay, and how much you will have to pay at the end of the day.

When a loan is in default, it is packaged into a portfolio of other defaulted loans. For example, let’s say a portfolio is built with 100 people’s defaulted student loans. This portfolio is then bid on by third party agencies that specialize in debt collection.

Once the loan has been transferred from the government, it is dinged with a collection charge. I can’t remember the exact phrase, or amount, but it was something around 2.5% of your loan balance. That means if your loan was $25,000 at the time it went into default it was now $25,625 the moment it arrives at the third-party collection’s agency.

You then get interest hits on the daily balance from there. I’m not sure what the specific percentage is, but most people I eventually talked with were floored with what they thought was $25,000 now being $45,000 after years of failed payment.

That’s not the end, though. If the first collection’s agency fails to collect on the balance, the portfolio can be shopped around to other agencies. Then, that initial collection’s charge gets tacked onto the balance at the time it leaves that office. Therefore, if it was $45,000 at the time it left my office to go to another the balance would be $46,125 the moment it arrives at the next.

**Conclusion**

I hope those with more information can help to correct anything I said or provide insight into more recent collection practices. I’m also happy to answer anything I can based upon my past.",4511.0,335.0,2025-05-05 16:02:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/1kffaqc/ysk_the_us_department_of_education_is_collecting/,2025-05-05 19:41:23.661236

,,,,,,,,popular,AITA for not forgiving my parents and sister after they cut me off (i had an affair with her HUSBAND),"I had an affair with my sister's husband when I was 16, yes I regret it and I truly am disgusted with my past self. When they found out my sister publicly shamed me ( fair enough) and told my parents ( also fair),  She also told our parents, which was fair, but she chose to stay with her husband and blamed me for ""seducing"" him into being unfaithful. She forgave him and decided to reconcile, while I was left to face the consequences. My parents kicked me out, and I had to scramble to find somewhere to live. Every time I found a new job, my parents and sister would contact my coworkers to call me a ""homewrecker."" They would harass me wherever I went, gossiping about my ""status."" While no one treated me differently to my face, the stares and whispers were unbearable. I had to leave the city and move to another just to escape them and for my mental health. Some people might say I'm overreacting but they really followed me like the plague.

I moved and met a nice elderly couple who never had kids who took me in, “mark and helen” and by that I mean they offered me to stay with them if I wanted and were so nice to me, I had my own place but I often visited them. To this day they mean the world to me. They knew what happened and i once even joked and had said something along the lines of “aren't you afraid i'll steal your husband as a homewrecker” she told me that me being a homewrecker wasn't my entire personality and to move on and learn from what i did. I eventually met my now-husband, and we have four children, all adults except for one who is 17. My kids know about my parents and the past situation, and they grew up considering Mark and Helen their grandparents, alongside my in-laws. Then, last Saturday, I received a **message**:::

I hope you can find it in your heart to read this message. I know we’ve been through so much pain and hardship, and I want to be honest with you about everything. I deeply regret how things have unfolded between us, especially the hurtful things we said and did in the past and I am truly sorry for all the pain we caused you.

Our actions have had lasting consequences. We never got to know our grandchildren, and I realize now how much we missed out on. XXXX husband cheated again and left her for someone else. I see how much she’s been suffering—she’s now a woman left alone with two kids caring for a disabled child and an autistic child who has it hard too, and trying to carry on despite everything. She has been so strong but it's not enough. We are in a difficult situation ourselves, struggling financially. We don’t have enough space or resources to help her directly, but we deeply want to support her and her children.

I am asking for your forgiveness. I know I  and your father don’t deserve it, but I hope you can see that we are trying to make amends, even if it's late. If there’s any way you can help us with financial support or guidance to assist Serna and her children, it would mean the world to us. We want to do right by them, and by you, if you’re willing to give us that chance.

We love you.

Ok, how we got into this predicament in the first place, is that my boyfriend just really likes his friend (Liam) he’s like a brother to him, he saved his life once, etc. But he’s on ALL our dates.

I even brought one of my single friends on a date (so we could double) and Liam and her don’t date, so that failed. I’ve honestly asked my BF “why Liam is on our dates“ and he says that Liam is, lonely, has nobody else, and he has NO SIBLINGS or girlfriend.

but then my boyfriend kind of guilts me because (I know this sounds awful) Liam is the fucking package for guilt! His Mom died when he was young, then his Dad and him don’t talk anymore, so Liam just doesn’t have anyone else to talk to.

I honestly think my boyfriend is guilt tripping me, and I don’t think I can do this relationship anymore. If nothing changes I’m leaving, this has gone on for 3 months.

Like, sure, I feel bad For Liam, but I don’t really know him, and its not my problem. its also not just dates, movie nights, hes here. Going to the mall, hes there, where is he not.

TL;DR my boyfriend keeps bringing his friend on our dates, and basically guilt trips me into not kicking his friend out.

also, I know this sounds made up, I still can’t believe it, but it is very much real. And I basically just need validation that its ok to break up with my boyfriend over this (the whole post).||

>Before ending it (you are fully validated on doing so based on your post) have you put your foot down? Why don't you plan dates and tell him his friend is not invited, period?

**OOP**

>>I have, but as I said in the post, he always, like, guilt trips me into letting him come.

>>saying this out loud, kind of just made me realize he’s manipulative

**TOP COMMENT**

**tsukiii**

>It’s OK to break up. You didn’t sign up to be the third wheel in your own relationship. He can spend as much time with Liam as he wants as a single dude.

|||EDIT: I called my soon to be ex boyfriend to meet up, and I’m gonna break up with him, I’m gonna tell him the exact reason honestly. I swear if Liam is there though, like, I’m not considering the possibility of not breaking up with him. It’s not even just because of Liam, its that he manipulates me into letting Liam come.

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/sN92qRVjk2)  **Apr 29, 2025**

**Editors Note: changed the initial X to Xavier for easier reading**

UPDATE: I broke up with my ex (I’m gonna call him Xavier) I went to where we agreed to meet up, and guess who he brought with him…you guessed it LIAM! I was very annoyed at this point, I told him I wanted to speak with him privately, and he brings fucking Liam. It’s very uncomfortable to break up with someone in front of their best friend, but I was too pissed, I told him “I said I wanted to speak privately“ he said “say it in front of Liam” eventually I just get annoyed and say “thats it! I don’t want Liam always here in our private life, on dates, everywhere“

he basically said, remember what I told you about Liams circumstance, blah blah blah. I said something like, “I’m sorry, but I don’t give a fuck about what Liams going through right now, this is about me breaking up with you” meanwhile Liam is just standing there…looking confused? I’ll get back to this later. So we basically get into a fight in this park, and it gets to the point where I tell him that he manipulates me into not kicking Liam out of our dates, and about everything he told me Liam went through (like a brother to Xavier, saved Xavier's life, dead mom, dad absent, no siblings, friends, or girlfriend)

and then Xavier looks like he got caught or something, and Liam gets angry saying like, “what did you tell her” this is all really funny and really awful at the same time. It turns out…NONE OF WHAT XAVIER TOLD ME WAS TRUE. Liam has a fiancée, has a REAL brother and sister, and his mom isn’t dead! So, anyway, definitely broke up with Xavier. Like, 40 minutes later, Liam DMs me basically saying that Xavier told Liam that I wasent ”comfortable“ being alone with Xavier, and that he thought I *wanted* him to be on the dates.

Sir, what? he said the reason why he agreed is because his fiancée is living in Europe to finish up her study abroad program, and he had nothing better to do. So Xavier just flat out is a liar, glad I broke up with him, mad I got lied to, but oh well. This was honestly not a turn of events I was expecting, and I have to get it out somewhere.

TL;DR Xavier is a liar and turns out everything he told me about Liam was false just to play a game or something.

,,,,,,,,all,Interviewer accused me of using AI during an interview because I looked off-screen to check my portfolio. I hung up on them.,"Had a 15-minute video interview with a CMO for a content marketing role. He started with fast-paced questions like “How do you make great content strategy?”

About 5 minutes in, I started glancing/looking off-screen to check my portfolio/website, which had examples related to what he was asking. I also mentioned I had notes I’d prepared, like I always do for interviews.

He suddenly paused and, in a pretty hostile tone, told me my “eye movements"" were ""disconcerting.” In a super smarmy tone he said something like, ""just a piece of interview feedback"" but it was clearly an accusation. 

I didn’t argue. After I told him the first time I have notes prepared for every interview, he doubled down and started saying something else about my eye movements, at which point I just hung up the zoom call, lol. 

Found out later he blocked me on LinkedIn. We weren’t even connected.

Still can’t believe how weird and confrontational that was. Has anyone else dealt with something like this?

,,,,,,,,all,I stopped defending my creative team and let leaders use ai… it failed lol,"I’m a creative director at a large company, and ever since AI blew up, suddenly everyone thinks they’re a creative.

I get it. It’s exciting when you can type a few prompts and get something that looks like a design. But now we’ve got prompt egos. People think a decent Midjourney mockup means they can lead brand, packaging, and ad strategy. 

I love ai jsut as much as them but I don’t call myself a financial expert jsut bc I can input our financials into ai and get a business model from it…. 

At first, I pushed back. Then I realized it was making me look insecure, so I let it ride. I watched as leadership signed up for every flashy AI tool and UGC software that promised to crank out content faster than my team ever could.

And guess what?

Everything is a mess. The software doesn’t work. The AI creators flaked. The UGC platform hasn’t delivered a single usable video in weeks. The packaging has typos and the wrong aspect ratios. Revenue has tanked. The social accounts are dead because nothing has passed legal.

Now those same tech bros are Slacking me nonstop, trying to fix the very problems they created when they cut the actual creatives.

All because some guy on TikTok told them AI could replace us.",7689.0,177.0,2025-05-05 21:17:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1kfn9jl/i_stopped_defending_my_creative_team_and_let/,2025-05-05 22:54:35.352570

,,,,,,,,popular,AITAH for breaking up with my gf for suggesting an Open relationship (and not letting her explain)?,"My gf of about 5 years recently suggested an open relationship. I know what it is, but just in case I misheard, I asked her to elaborate, and yeah... Pretty much what you would think. She wanted us to be able to have sex with others.

I took a deep breath and said that we were done. I've seen stories about open relationships and know that there's no way in hell I'd ever want one.

She tried to take it back, but I told her that the fact she had the nerve to even ask is a deal breaker. FYI, we had NEVER done anything with another person, and I have never suggested any of it, so there's no way I ever gave her any hints. This is something I'd want. I didn't even listen to her and just ignored her as she kept trying to explain and apologize. 

I just packed some stuff and went to stay with my parents. She's been trying to call me, but honestly... I feel like asking for an open relationship is basically asking for permission to cheat.

,,,,,,,,all,"Honestly, I don’t get the hype around Baldur’s Gate 3","I get it……I tried.

I put in 400ish hours. But I just don’t see what everyone is freaking out about. A few things that really didn’t work for me:

-The pacing is all over the place. One minute I’m in a casual tavern chat, next thing I know I’m locked in a moral debate with a talking brain in a jar. Feels jarring.

-Too many dialogue options. Like, I don’t need 6 different ways to express sarcasm. Just let me click “continue.”

-The world reacts too much to what I do. I freed a gnome and 40 hours later someone brought it up again. How am I supposed to live with that kind of consequence?

-The cinematics make everything feel too immersive. Like, sometimes I forget I’m just playing a game and not in a Netflix series I accidentally joined.

-The characters? Way too much depth. Why does everyone have such strong backstories and emotional arcs? It’s distracting.

-And don’t even get me started on the companions. I was just trying to fight goblins, not catch feelings for a morally complex vampire.

So yeah. Totally overrated. Only made me feel things I haven’t felt since Witcher 3. I guess if you like emotional damage and high standards for future games, go for it.

But for me? Never playing it again. (I started another run yesterday)",2455.0,221.0,2025-05-06 10:49:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/BaldursGate3/comments/1kg1fsu/honestly_i_dont_get_the_hype_around_baldurs_gate_3/,2025-05-05 23:02:56.311588
,,,,,,,,all,To the mean truck driver who stopped to help me a decade ago,"I was 17, exhausted from a long shift, and stranded late at night with a flat tire. You pulled over, took one look, and stated the obvious like it was gospel.

“Flat tire,” you said. Not a question.

“Bet you’ve got no clue how to change it.” Also not a question.

“You probably don’t even know where your spare is.”

I answered every one of your blunt observations with a polite “no, sir,” and you wasted no time tearing into the idea that any father would send his daughter out driving without teaching her how to handle a tire change.

Back then, I thought you were rude, harsh, and unnecessarily tough as you made me do most of the work under your supervision. But I followed every instruction. I memorized every step.

And today, ten years later, when I found myself in the same situation, I knew exactly what to do.

So, to the man who seemed more drill sergeant than Good Samaritan thank you. You didn’t just help that night you taught me something that stuck. I didn’t appreciate it enough then, but I truly do now.",5897.0,87.0,2025-05-06 05:22:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1kfwtzz/to_the_mean_truck_driver_who_stopped_to_help_me_a/,2025-05-05 23:02:56.311588

,,,,,,,,all,How I got two men to understand why some women avoid “nice” gestures or small talk from men they don’t know,"I wanted to share this because it really *clicked* for the two guys I explained it to, and maybe it can help others too.

We were talking about why some women in public might seem cold or uninterested when a man tries to make friendly small talk or do something “nice”  even if his intentions are good. They didn’t *get* why women ( who aren't rude  or arrogant) wouldn’t at least respond to niceness with matched energy....or why we sometimes avoid it altogether.

So I gave the best on the spot analogy I could: You know when you’re in Walmart or Best Buy and there’s a salesperson or rep trying to stop you to ask who your mobile or Wi-Fi provider is? You already know that 9 times out of 10, the question is just an opener — they want to sell you something, sign you up, waste your time. 

The *nicest* thing you can do for yourself is avoid the interaction entirely.  
It’s not personal, it’s just the least rude and most efficient way to get what you want: go about your business in peace.

The mean or bitchy  way would be to stop and tell them to f off or loudly say NO, but most of us prefer to just avoid the whole situation if possible.

I put in 400ish hours. But I just don’t see what everyone is freaking out about. A few things that really didn’t work for me:

-The pacing is all over the place. One minute I’m in a casual tavern chat, next thing I know I’m locked in a moral debate with a talking brain in a jar. Feels jarring.

-Too many dialogue options. Like, I don’t need 6 different ways to express sarcasm. Just let me click “continue.”

-The world reacts too much to what I do. I freed a gnome and 40 hours later someone brought it up again. How am I supposed to live with that kind of consequence?

-The cinematics make everything feel too immersive. Like, sometimes I forget I’m just playing a game and not in a Netflix series I accidentally joined.

-The characters? Way too much depth. Why does everyone have such strong backstories and emotional arcs? It’s distracting.

-And don’t even get me started on the companions. I was just trying to fight goblins, not catch feelings for a morally complex vampire.

**TRIGGER WARNING:** >!Manipulation, slander!<

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/UcEacb3Is5)  **Apr 29, 2025**

Ok, how we got into this predicament in the first place, is that my boyfriend just really likes his friend (Liam) he’s like a brother to him, he saved his life once, etc. But he’s on ALL our dates.

I even brought one of my single friends on a date (so we could double) and Liam and her don’t date, so that failed. I’ve honestly asked my BF “why Liam is on our dates“ and he says that Liam is, lonely, has nobody else, and he has NO SIBLINGS or girlfriend.

but then my boyfriend kind of guilts me because (I know this sounds awful) Liam is the fucking package for guilt! His Mom died when he was young, then his Dad and him don’t talk anymore, so Liam just doesn’t have anyone else to talk to.

I honestly think my boyfriend is guilt tripping me, and I don’t think I can do this relationship anymore. If nothing changes I’m leaving, this has gone on for 3 months.

Like, sure, I feel bad For Liam, but I don’t really know him, and its not my problem. its also not just dates, movie nights, hes here. Going to the mall, hes there, where is he not.

TL;DR my boyfriend keeps bringing his friend on our dates, and basically guilt trips me into not kicking his friend out.

also, I know this sounds made up, I still can’t believe it, but it is very much real. And I basically just need validation that its ok to break up with my boyfriend over this (the whole post).||

>It’s OK to break up. You didn’t sign up to be the third wheel in your own relationship. He can spend as much time with Liam as he wants as a single dude.

|||EDIT: I called my soon to be ex boyfriend to meet up, and I’m gonna break up with him, I’m gonna tell him the exact reason honestly. I swear if Liam is there though, like, I’m not considering the possibility of not breaking up with him. It’s not even just because of Liam, its that he manipulates me into letting Liam come.

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/sN92qRVjk2)  **Apr 29, 2025**

**Editors Note: changed the initial X to Xavier for easier reading**

UPDATE: I broke up with my ex (I’m gonna call him Xavier) I went to where we agreed to meet up, and guess who he brought with him…you guessed it LIAM! I was very annoyed at this point, I told him I wanted to speak with him privately, and he brings fucking Liam. It’s very uncomfortable to break up with someone in front of their best friend, but I was too pissed, I told him “I said I wanted to speak privately“ he said “say it in front of Liam” eventually I just get annoyed and say “thats it! I don’t want Liam always here in our private life, on dates, everywhere“

he basically said, remember what I told you about Liams circumstance, blah blah blah. I said something like, “I’m sorry, but I don’t give a fuck about what Liams going through right now, this is about me breaking up with you” meanwhile Liam is just standing there…looking confused? I’ll get back to this later. So we basically get into a fight in this park, and it gets to the point where I tell him that he manipulates me into not kicking Liam out of our dates, and about everything he told me Liam went through (like a brother to Xavier, saved Xavier's life, dead mom, dad absent, no siblings, friends, or girlfriend)

and then Xavier looks like he got caught or something, and Liam gets angry saying like, “what did you tell her” this is all really funny and really awful at the same time. It turns out…NONE OF WHAT XAVIER TOLD ME WAS TRUE. Liam has a fiancée, has a REAL brother and sister, and his mom isn’t dead! So, anyway, definitely broke up with Xavier. Like, 40 minutes later, Liam DMs me basically saying that Xavier told Liam that I wasent ”comfortable“ being alone with Xavier, and that he thought I *wanted* him to be on the dates.

Sir, what? he said the reason why he agreed is because his fiancée is living in Europe to finish up her study abroad program, and he had nothing better to do. So Xavier just flat out is a liar, glad I broke up with him, mad I got lied to, but oh well. This was honestly not a turn of events I was expecting, and I have to get it out somewhere.

TL;DR Xavier is a liar and turns out everything he told me about Liam was false just to play a game or something.

,,,,,,,,popular,"Am I the Jerk for refusing to let myister-in-law stay at my house because she’s ""a vegan with a peanut allergy""?","

So, I (28F) live in a small but cozy two-bedroom apartment in a city where rent is sky-high. I’ve always loved having friends and family over, but it’s usually limited to a weekend or a quick visit—long-term stays are pretty much off the table. My husband (29M) and I agreed that we’d keep things simple and comfortable, which brings us to the current dilemma.

My sister-in-law, “Mara” (26F), is coming into town for a conference next week. She lives about 5 hours away, and while we don’t exactly *dislike* each other, we’re not super close. We’ve always had a bit of a tension between us. She’s very… particular. She’s vegan (which I totally respect), but she’s *also* severely allergic to peanuts, which, no big deal, but she *literally* asks for separate pans and plates for every meal she eats. That’s fine when it’s a visit over lunch or dinner, but she’s requested that I cook and serve *every* meal this way during her stay.

Here’s the kicker: she also *requires* that my entire apartment be peanut-free and vegan-friendly for her visit. She said she’s “highly sensitive,” so I should remove anything with peanut oil, peanut butter, or any trace of non-vegan foods in the kitchen. And no, she won't be eating out, because, in her words, “restaurants can’t guarantee no cross-contamination.”

I work full-time and have a pretty hectic schedule, so I’ve asked her multiple times if she could just stay in a nearby Airbnb or a hotel. But she insists that since my place is so much more “comfortable and homey,” she’ll “just sleep on the couch” and make herself at home. My husband is neutral, saying it’s up to me, but he *has* mentioned that “she’s family” and maybe I should be more accommodating.

I love my sister-in-law, but I don’t think it’s realistic to cater to every single one of her dietary restrictions in my tiny apartment. Plus, I just don’t think I should have to turn my life upside down to accommodate one person for a week. I’m honestly starting to feel resentful that she thinks I should do all of this when she could easily stay at a hotel, but maybe I’m being too harsh?

So, Am I the Jerk for refusing to let her stay?

,,,,,,,,all,I did it. I got a dumpster. My kids are NOT dealing with what I just did.,"Both of my parents are gone. My father passed in February. Emptying the house was a nightmare. There were a lot of great mementos, but where do you draw the line? 

We found so many things that are really cool but they were hidden away. They basically just took up space. So! Much! Stuff! I was torn between keeping things for nostalgia or being realistic. Then I realized that keeping things for the sake of nostalgia was what caused all this chaos. 
We kept some precious momentos and donated a lot of things. But it's May now and just finished the job. We ended up throwing out a lot of stuff. I'm willing to bet my parents put them away and never looked at them again.

I get it, I want to keep everything with a memory attached. But this opened my eyes. What stuff do I have saved just to save it? Stuff I never look at? 

So I did it. I got a dumpster and yesterday I went through everything and just got rid of it. I told my kids to get what they want because I'm getting rid of everything else. I kept a few things for myself. 

I don't want my kids to spend months going through my things and figuring out what to throw away, what to keep, and what to donate. 

It was freeing. I understand why they kept the stuff, I feel the same way about my things. But it reaches a point where it's almost ridiculous. I'm glad I did it. Today I'm doing a really deep cleaning of my home. It'll be wonderful when I'm done, almost like a new start.

He is super controlling, jealous, and always checking her location. Once, he called her nine times while we were just shopping at Target. Amy keeps defending him, saying he is just protective because he cares so much. Whatever 
At her bachelorette party, it was supposed to be a fun girls night, but Jake kept blowing up her phone. Texts, FaceTimes, asking where she was, accusing her of acting single. She kept leaving to call him back, crying and apologizing, while the rest of us sat there awkwardly. After about the fourth time she left the table, I just lost it. When she came back, I said loud enough for the whole table to hear
You are not marrying a husband, you are signing up for a lifetime of being babysat by a jealous manchild. Amy started crying and ran out of the bar, half the girls followed her
Later that night, her mom called me, drunk, thanking me, because apparently they have all been worried about Jake but did not know how to stop the wedding. Her mom told Amy if she goes through with the wedding, they will not pay for it. Now Amy has blocked Jake, moved out of their apartment, and moved back into her parents house.

,,,,,,,,popular,AITAH Wife spent the night at a friends house,"I'll keep this pretty simple. We're both in our 40s. Together 11 years, married for 8.

About 2 or 3 years ago my wife ran into her ex-boyfriend, whom she lived with previously. They chatted and caught up with her. To be clear they were part of the same friend group before dating.

They'd bump into each other about every few and they'd chit chat and catch up on things at a nearby diner. 

About two week ago she hung out with him and his friends until 10pm, 5+ hours after she got off. 

She knew I did not like this, I don't think I'd be in the minority in this. But she has never given me reason to doubt her and she doesn't have a deep bench of friends.

Yesterday they met up again after work.She checked in around 3 hours after they met up letting me know was was fine.

I did my own thing at home until I basically just said fuck it and went to bed.

I received the below text message at 1245am.

>Her: Lost track of time. Gonna just go to work from here.

Look, I trust my wife, she's never before given me reason not to, and I know the realization her previous friend group has moved on has hit her hard recent.

Even given that I feel like I'm being gaslit and at a bare minimum this is extremely disrespectful.

,,,,,,,,popular,AITA for refusing to let my daughter’s fiancé stay in our guest room because I use it for my hobby?,"So I (M49) might be in the wrong here, but I honestly don’t think I am, and would love to hear outside perspectives.

My daughter (23F) got engaged recently and came to visit us with her fiancé (24M). We live a few states away, so I get that traveling is tiring, but we were happy to host, for the weekend.

Now, I’ve had my guest room set up for my miniature wargaming for the past few years. It’s my space, where I go to decompress after work, and it's honestly the only spot in the house that's fully mine. My wife has the sunroom, and the rest of the house is kind of communal. I’ve got thousands of dollars of models in there, custom terrain, a 3D printer setup, etc. It’s not just a hobby, it’s an investment, and frankly, a form of art.

Anyway, when they arrived, I had the office couch made up for them, pull-out, memory foam, decent blanket, very clean. My daughter seemed fine with it, but her fiancé kind of made a face and later asked why they couldn’t just sleep in the guest room. I told him plainly it wasn’t available because it’s not a guest room anymore. It’s my studio.

Later that night, my daughter confronted me privately and said I was being selfish and ridiculous and that it’s just for two nights. She said they felt unwelcome and like I was prioritizing plastic figurines over family. I told her that’s not fair, they have a place to sleep. It’s not like I made them sleep on the floor.

Now my wife is giving me the cold shoulder and said I could have just packed it up for a weekend, but again, it’s not like these are toys you throw in a box. Some of them are fragile. Some are half-painted. I don’t want to spend days reorganizing and then undoing all that work just because they didn’t like the setup.

They left a day early, and now I’m getting texts from my daughter about how I chose my hobby over her happiness, which just seems dramatic to me.

I might be the asshole because maybe I could’ve moved some stuff around for a few nights, but I really don’t think it’s fair to expect me to dismantle my entire setup just because someone didn’t want to sleep on a perfectly good pull-out. I have a right to my space too, right?",6030.0,3439.0,2025-05-06 16:29:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1kg8vng/aita_for_refusing_to_let_my_daughters_fiancé_stay/,2025-05-06 16:18:50.261007
,,,,,,,,popular,GTA VI | Trailer 2 + New Information Megathread,"Since we've been flooded with thousands of posts and articles of the trailer, some of them with there links broken, some with abominable titles and others with the youtube link scuffed, this thread can be used for a comprehensive detail of everything Rockstar has released today.

This thread will keep updating with all the information, refresh every once in a while.

**Trailer** **2** \- [https://youtu.be/VQRLujxTm3c?si=I2L6zrTSZSt9W1SX](https://youtu.be/VQRLujxTm3c?si=I2L6zrTSZSt9W1SX)

**Official Plot:** “Set in Vice City, Jason & Lucia have always known the deck is stacked against them. But when an easy score goes wrong, they find themselves on the darkest side of the sunniest place in America, in the middle of a conspiracy stretching across the state of Leonida — forced to rely on each other more than ever if they want to make it out alive”

Rockstar has also released new info on their website: [https://www.rockstargames.com/VI](https://www.rockstargames.com/VI)

A detail of some of the characters below, starting out with the two main protagonists **Jason and Lucia**:

# Jason Duval

Jason wants an easy life, but things just keep getting harder.

Jason grew up around grifters and crooks. After a stint in the Army trying to shake off his troubled teens, he found himself in the Keys doing what he knows best, working for local drug runners. It might be time to try something new.

Meeting Lucia could be the best or worst thing to ever happen to him. Jason knows how he'd like it to turn out but right now, it's hard to tell.

# Lucia Caminos

Lucia’s father taught her to fight as soon as she could walk.

Life has been coming at her swinging ever since. Fighting for her family landed her in the Leonida Penitentiary. Sheer luck got her out. Lucia’s learned her lesson — only smart moves from here.

More than anything, Lucia wants the good life her mom has dreamed of since their days in Liberty City — but instead of half-baked fantasies, Lucia is prepared to take matters into her own hands.

# Cal Hampton

What if everything on the internet was true?

Jason’s friend and a fellow associate of Brian’s, Cal feels safest hanging at home, snooping on Coast Guard comms with a few beers and some private browser tabs open. Cal Hampton

""The psychopaths are in charge. Get used to it.""

Cal is at the low tide of America and happy there. Casual paranoia loves company, but his friend Jason has bigger plans.

# Boobie Ike

It's all about heart — the Jack of Hearts.

Boobie is a local Vice City legend — and acts like it. One of the few to transform his time in the streets into a legitimate empire spanning real estate, a strip club, and a recording studio — Boobie's all smiles until it's time to talk business.

""The club money pay for the studio, and the drug money pay for it all.""

Top quality cuts.

Boobie might seem like he's just out for himself, but it's his partnership with the young aspiring music mogul Dre'Quan for Only Raw Records that he's most invested in — now they just need a hit.

https://preview.redd.it/30utmhzd56ze1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=de6bb7fe87b225670b697ba9265d536a719db3fb

# Dre'Quan Priest

Only Raw... Records

Dre'Quan was always more of a hustler than a gangster. Even when he was dealing on the streets to make ends meet, breaking into music was the goal.

""Dancers are like my A&Rs. If the record's a hit, DJs gonna be spinnin' it.""

You're with the label now.

Now that he's signed the Real Dimez, Dre'Quan's days of booking acts into Boobie's strip club might be numbered as he sets his sights on the Vice City scene.

# Real Dimez

Viral videos. Viral hooks.

Bae-Luxe and Roxy aka Real Dimez have been friends since high school — girls with the savvy to turn their time shaking down local dealers into cold, hard cash via spicy rap tracks and a relentless social media presence.

""All my dimes in this club. Meet my twin, make it a dub.""

One hit away from fame.

An early hit single with local rapper DWNPLY took Real Dimez to new heights. Now, after five years and a whole lot of trouble, they’re signed to Only Raw Records, hoping lightning can strike twice.

https://preview.redd.it/8he2i8lz66ze1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=545da6c0b0fc19db99f97ec8de70d814b9d42ae0

# Raul Bautista

Experience counts.

Confidence, charm, and cunning — Raul’s a seasoned bank robber always on the hunt for talent ready to take the risks that bring the biggest rewards.

""Life is full of surprises, my friend. I think we'd all be wise to remember that.""

A professional adapts.

Raul's recklessness raises the stakes with every score. Sooner or later, his crew will have to double down or pull their chips from the table.

# Brian Heder

Nothing better than a Mudslide at sunset.

Brian's a classic drug runner from the golden age of smuggling in the Keys. Still moving product through his boat yard with his third wife, Lori, Brian's been around long enough to let others do his dirty work.

""I hauled so much grass in that plane, I could make the state of Leonida levitate.""

Looks like a Leonida beach bum — moves like a great white shark.

Brian’s letting Jason live rent-free at one of his properties — so long as he helps with local shakedowns, and stops by for Lori’s sangria once in a while.

Now info on some of the locations:

# VICE CITY

Everything in Excess

We're a long way from the '80s, but Vice City is still the sun and fun capital of America.

The glamour, hustle, and greed of America captured in a single city. Each neighborhood has something to offer, from the pastel art deco hotels and bright white sands of Ocean Beach, to the bustling panaderías of Little Cuba and the bootleg brands of the Tisha-Wocka flea market, out to the VC Port, the cruise ship capital of the world.

# GRASSRIVERS

Welcome to the Wetlands

The untamable jewel of Leonida’s crown.

You never know what lies beneath the surface of this primordial expanse. The gators may be the most famous attraction, but there are far deadlier predators and weirder discoveries among the mangroves.

# PORT GELLHORN

  
Live Hard

This is Leonida’s forgotten coast.

Cheap motels, shut-down attractions, and empty strip malls won’t bring the tourists back, but there’s a new economy in this once-popular vacation spot. It’s fueled by malt liquor, painkillers, and truck stop energy drinks. Jump on a dirt bike and hold onto your wallet.

AMBROSIA

Keeping Leonida Sweet

The battle for the health and wealth of Leonida begins here.

In the heart of Leonida, American industry and old school values still reign supreme — whatever the cost. The Allied Crystal sugar refinery provides the jobs, while the local biker gang provides almost everything else.

# MOUNT KALAGA NATIONAL PARK

  
Wild, Wild Country

Room to breathe on the state's northern fringes.

A national landmark up against the state’s northern border, Mount Kalaga offers prime hunting, fishing, and off-road trails. In the lush surrounding backwoods, hillbilly mystics and paranoid radicals live far from the prying eyes of the government.

,,,,,,,,popular,I did it. I got a dumpster. My kids are NOT dealing with what I just did.,"Both of my parents are gone. My father passed in February. Emptying the house was a nightmare. There were a lot of great mementos, but where do you draw the line? 

We found so many things that are really cool but they were hidden away. They basically just took up space. So! Much! Stuff! I was torn between keeping things for nostalgia or being realistic. Then I realized that keeping things for the sake of nostalgia was what caused all this chaos. 
We kept some precious momentos and donated a lot of things. But it's May now and just finished the job. We ended up throwing out a lot of stuff. I'm willing to bet my parents put them away and never looked at them again.

I get it, I want to keep everything with a memory attached. But this opened my eyes. What stuff do I have saved just to save it? Stuff I never look at? 

So I did it. I got a dumpster and yesterday I went through everything and just got rid of it. I told my kids to get what they want because I'm getting rid of everything else. I kept a few things for myself. 

I don't want my kids to spend months going through my things and figuring out what to throw away, what to keep, and what to donate. 

It was freeing. I understand why they kept the stuff, I feel the same way about my things. But it reaches a point where it's almost ridiculous. I'm glad I did it. Today I'm doing a really deep cleaning of my home. It'll be wonderful when I'm done, almost like a new start.

Happy Tuesday! 🙂

,,,,,,,,popular,AITAH for telling my best friend her marriage is doomed at her bachelorette party and accidentally getting the wedding canceled,"This weekend was a disaster...

I 27F have been best friends with Amy 28F for years. She has been with this guy Jake for about three years, and honestly, he is a walking red flag. He is super controlling, jealous, and always checking her location. Once, he called her nine times while we were just shopping at Target. Amy keeps defending him, saying he is just protective because he cares so much. Whatever 
At her bachelorette party, it was supposed to be a fun girls night, but Jake kept blowing up her phone. Texts, FaceTimes, asking where she was, accusing her of acting single. She kept leaving to call him back, crying and apologizing, while the rest of us sat there awkwardly. After about the fourth time she left the table, I just lost it. When she came back, I said loud enough for the whole table to hear
You are not marrying a husband, you are signing up for a lifetime of being babysat by a jealous manchild. Amy started crying and ran out of the bar, half the girls followed her
Later that night, her mom called me, drunk, thanking me, because apparently they have all been worried about Jake but did not know how to stop the wedding. Her mom told Amy if she goes through with the wedding, they will not pay for it. Now Amy has blocked Jake, moved out of their apartment, and moved back into her parents house. But she also blocked me for humiliating her
Half our friend group is saying I did the right thing. The other half is calling me jealous and toxic for blowing up her relationship right before the wedding.

,,,,,,,,popular,"Now that the Switch 1 generation is winding down, what were your most DISAPPOINTING purchases on this console?","Every game console, no matter how well or poorly it sold, is gonna have some disappointments thrown in there. Especially if said disappointments came from 1st party developers. I have 3 big candidates based on my own purchases, starting with my biggest letdown:

**1) Mario Strikers Battle League:** After frantically buying this game to play some multiplayer matches with friends, I realized what a terrible mistake I made after chewing through all the single player content in a matter of days. There is *nothing* to do in this game besides regular soccer matches, the online is abysmal, and the amount of content available at launch and even now is just laughable for a sequel. I thought my perception of Mario Strikers as a whole would be ruined forever, so I went ahead and booted up Strikers Charged on Wii and nope, that game holds up incredibly well! This was just a bad sequel all around.

**2) Mario Golf Super Rush:** Speaking of bad sequels, Super Rush decided to simplify the golfing mechanics to a point where it just isn’t fun to play for me. As someone who adored the 3DS game Mario Golf World Tour, which was packed with content, modes, and unlockables and had worthwhile paid DLC on top of that, Super Rush felt like it was playing catch up with all its free updates. Was this how Animal Crossing fans felt when New Horizons was first released, having to wait months for features that were already available in the 3DS predecessor? Yikes.

**3) Splatoon 3:** This is more of a personal pick than a general consensus. I really got into Splatoon 1 and 2, but I was just Splatoon’d out by the time the third game came around. No new modes, online that had more disconnects than either of the first two games in my experience, and a longer grind for unlockables that could rival a modern day hero shooter. Call me old but I missed the more “pick up and play” nature of Splatoon 1, and I just don’t get that with Splatoon 3. Also the fact that they sold the first game’s hubworld back as paid DLC is utter nonsense to me.",934.0,1582.0,2025-05-06 21:33:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1kggeu8/now_that_the_switch_1_generation_is_winding_down/,2025-05-06 16:18:50.261007
,,,,,,,,popular,Non-premium Spotify is the worst thing I have ever seen,"EDIT 2: I wasn't expecting this much interest in my post. I've realized I'm a whiny bitch. Sorry. Will not happen again, you all are right about it being cheap. I'll probably get premium at some point, I just don't have the money right now. I still think the ""not being able to choose a song unless you pay"" thing is bogus in 2025 though



Small rant ahead- Spotify makes me angry and I want to talk about it


I primarily use YT Music, so I was shocked when I saw that you can't choose to play a specific song/album on spotify mobile even if you search it up and click it specifically, unless you pay for premium. It just plays a ""suggested song"" instead, which is something similar to the one you want to listen to or made by the same artist.

I understand that this is their tactic to get people to buy premium, but it doesnt make me want to buy premium. It just makes me want to go back to YT music where the only major feature locked behind premium is background play. You can choose your song, make playlists, and listen as much as you want, including things only posted on Youtube (like video game soundtracks). Why would I want to support spotify when I can just use Youtube music?

EDIT: Someone in the comments put it perfectly: they're creating a problem to coax you into buying premium. I haven't seen any other music streaming site that doesn't allow you to do something as simple as choose a specific song. 

And yes, I understand that it used to be worse. I understand you used to have to pay for entire CDs, or wait to listen to music, but that's not the world we live in anymore. The world is changing alarmingly fast at this point, and maybe buying all your music as physical copies USED to be the norm, but its not anymore. The norm was set by free streaming sites like Youtube, Soundcloud, and even Newgrounds (among others that I can't remember). Yes, you should have to pay premium for a premium experience, but in 2025, you shouldn't have to pay to choose the song you listen to.",4921.0,1043.0,2025-05-06 13:05:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1kg3zaz/nonpremium_spotify_is_the_worst_thing_i_have_ever/,2025-05-06 16:18:50.261007
,,,,,,,,all,Lost a friend to Trump...,"I just lost my best friend. I’m a 33‑year‑old man, and he’s been in my life literally since birth. I’m **bawling** my eyes out right now, but I know I’m making the right decision and can only hope he eventually sees the light. For anyone reading this: I’m sorry, but it will get political. I’ve never cut someone off over politics before, and it sucks. If you’d rather avoid politics, please skip this post.

We grew up side by side—playing nonstop, inventing board games, taking turns on the computer to play *Warcraft*. Most of my earliest memories are with him. We both came from very religious, very political households and grew up listening to Glenn Beck, Rush Limbaugh, etc. As I got older, I saw the hypocrisy in many of those shows and drifted left. That was never a problem; we disagreed, but we both believed we were trying to help our fellow humans. We still play video games weekly, and until recently I thought our friendship was unbreakable.

He voted for Trump in 2024, which I chalked up to our usual political divide. Since then, though, I keep seeing genuinely totalitarian things Trump is doing, and my friend keeps brushing them off. A month ago I asked him—gently—to do some research on a few topics. He said he would. Today we talked again: he still supports Trump, still hasn’t looked into any of the issues I raised—CECOT detentions without due process, Kilmer Garcia, Ukraine, Canada, the list goes on. I pleaded with him, and he treated it like a normal political disagreement.

If he were just a typical Republican, no issue. If he hadn’t voted for Trump and we just disagreed, fine. But he *did* vote for Trump, posted a multi‑page essay urging everyone else to vote Trump, and now shrugs when I point out that Trump is literally running concentration camps. If you’re going to vote for someone doing that, at least be willing to own it.

After that conversation, I think I have to cut him off. I’m overwhelmed and just need somewhere to rant. To any conservatives reading: I know, I’m just a “stupid libtard” throwing away a friendship over nothing. But I can’t stay close to someone who supports a man sending people to camps and can’t be bothered to research it. I’m depressed, sad, and upset. I’ll be fine in the long run, but today I’m down a friend, and it hurts. Thanks for letting me vent.",2336.0,320.0,2025-05-07 08:09:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/50501/comments/1kgs1e5/lost_a_friend_to_trump/,2025-05-07 13:10:26.173373
,,,,,,,,all,AITA for refusing to spend Mother's Day with my ex and his wife celebrating her so our kids will?,"My ex-husband and I share custody of our 17 year old daughter and 15 year old son. We divorced 12 years ago and co-parented with difficulty ever since. My ex is remarried and there were tensions between the three of us for the majority of that time. My ex's wife came in with huge expectations of what she would be to the kids and how involved I would be and none of it was realistic.

* She thought I would agree to giving my ex primary custody and I would be a one weekend a month mom. When that wasn't what happened she expected everything mom related to be split equally between us. So alternating Mother's Day, taking turns doing the Mother's Day events at school or activities and even changing who was listed as their mom on certain forms. And she really believed that was something I would do and something that would cause zero problems with schools and doctors.
* She expected the kids to call her mom as soon as her wedding ring was on her finger and she believed I would ""encourage"", meaning force, them to call her mom. This was a long standing expectation that never got met. Not one time.
* She expected to have the same legal authority as my ex and I had. And that she would get to make certain decisions for the kids without my ex's or my input. Those being where they went to school, what doctors they saw and what summer camp's they'd go to and for how long. She also expected to decide a religion for them.
* She wanted to change their last name to a hyphenated name with hers and mine and ex's. She fully expected this to happen too. There was more than a year of her throwing a tantrum because I shut the idea down.

My ex's wife comes from money and is used to having things her own way. So not getting her expectations met made her increasingly bitter toward me. She alienated my kids by being too pushy, controlling and trying to change their lives to fit what she believes they should be. Case in point she tried to fight to get them into private school and pressured them to ask me. She wanted my daughter to be in cheer and music classes up to 6 times a week and she wanted my son in football and boxing six times a week. My kids weren't interested in those activities and she brought them along multiple times and tried to make them take part. She told them that's what boys and girls did.

She insulted the parents of my son's best friend and then attempted to stop all contact between the two kids. She hated me for refusing to back her up. The kids hated her for all of this. While she was thinking of them as her kids, they were wishing their dad would divorce her and I know they asked at least twice for him to do just that. When his wife learned she blamed me.

The kids make a point of spending as little time as possible with her. They do not appreciate her and that bothers my ex and his wife. He and I have discussed it but he told me they should and that I was bitter for not making them appreciate her. He said she made their lives better no matter what the kids think or say.

My ex and his wife did not have a child together until last year and this coming Mother's Day is her first one as a mom. The day has always been a sore topic for her because the kids are with me and she have anyone but my ex treating her like a mom. Now she officially is one and she believed that would mean my kids would be there for Mother's Day going forward but they set the record straight, as did I when asked about it. Now my ex has come up with this insane idea that I should spend the day celebrating his wife and join in their Mother's Day celebrations. He said she's worth celebrating, it's her first time having her own child on Mother's Day and our kids should be there but won't if I'm not.

I shut his idea down hard and told him I would not spend the day with his wife. He tried to turn it into a fight but I walked away from him and have not answered his calls since. He has sent a few texts telling me I need to reconsider. But I ignored those as well and then he sent his sister after me. She told me it was so petty of me to not even consider meeting in the middle somewhere and then she stated I was rude about everything. She said I was the reason the kids didn't like their stepmother and with a half sibling now I needed to figure it out. I walked away from her as well but more texts from my ex followed.

The only thing giving me pause is the fact my ex's family doesn't like the new wife. So the fact ex's sister said what she did is making me question a tiny bit if I'm TA.",2649.0,447.0,2025-05-07 08:33:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1kgscyh/aita_for_refusing_to_spend_mothers_day_with_my_ex/,2025-05-07 13:44:58.212152

With the rise of ""egg culture"", neopronouns & people using ""it/its"" pronouns, the greater trans community has in many ways lost the plot.

By watering down what it means to be trans, people who are not trans are being convinced they are trans. People are sold a story that they can ""create their own gender"", like its a fashion style.

Stories of detransition in the trans community are often hand-waved away because detransitioners are often assumed to be ""bad actors"". And if you detransition, you will get no support from the trans community.

You will likely be labeled a ""TERF"", because it is a common conspriacy theory in the trans community that detransitioners are largely just ""gender critical shills"".  This scares people away from detransitioning if they feel that transition isn't right for them.

I'm still fuming about this interview process I went through last month. A small but growing digital agency reached out to ME on LinkedIn about a web developer position. Seemed legit their portfolio had some decent work and they were offering competitive pay.

After two interviews, they asked me to complete a ""technical assessment"" build a functional landing page for one of their ""potential clients"" in the tourism industry. They provided mockups and asked for a working prototype with some specific functionality.

I spent THREE DAYS building this thing responsive design, custom animations, booking form integration. Even added some accessibility features they didn't request. Their feedback? ""Absolutely brilliant work, exactly what we're looking for!""

Then radio silence for a week. No response to follow-ups.

Yesterday, my friend who works in tourism sent me a link to a ""hot new website"" for a local tour company... MY EXACT CODE was live, with minimal changes! They'd simply taken my ""assessment,"" made a few tweaks, and delivered it to their paying client.

I immediately contacted the agency owner who had the nerve to say ""the assessment materials clearly stated all submissions become company property."" I checked my emails nothing like that was ever mentioned. Now I'm sending them an invoice for $3,800 and consulting with a lawyer friend. They've already made at least $10K off my free labor.

,,,,,,,,all,"Got denied remote work during cancer treatment, then fired for ""productivity issues"" while on chemo","I need to vent about the most dehumanizing work experience of my life.

Last fall, I was diagnosed with stage 2 lymphoma. After the initial shock, I immediately sat down with my manager at HealthPlus Insurance (where I'd been a claims analyst for 3+ years) to discuss accommodations during my treatment.

My oncologist recommended I work remotely during chemo to reduce infection risk. I had documentation, a doctor's note, everything. My direct manager seemed supportive until HR got involved.

Their response? ""Remote work is a privilege, not an accommodation."" They claimed my role was ""impossible to perform remotely"" despite the ENTIRE DEPARTMENT working from home during COVID just months earlier.

The ""compromise"" they offered was to let me take unpaid FMLA on my chemo days but required me in-office all other days. When I pointed out this violated ADA, the HR director had the audacity to say: ""We employ 49 people, we're exempt from ADA requirements.""

I tried to make it work - showing up between treatments despite fatigue, nausea, and a compromised immune system during flu season. My performance obviously suffered.

After my second round of chemo, they put me on a ""performance improvement plan"" for missing metrics. Two weeks later, I was terminated for ""failing to meet productivity standards"" - literally while my white blood cell count was at its lowest.

The final insult? They contested my unemployment claim saying I was fired ""for cause.""

I got a lawyer. Turns out they actually had 53 employees (they counted part-timers differently), making them subject to ADA. Yesterday we filed with the EEOC.

This company's entire business is HEALTH INSURANCE but they couldn't show basic humanity to someone going through cancer treatment.

,,,,,,,,all,AITAH for giving my daughters one week to leave my house after what they did to their half brother?,"
I have two daughters. Both over 20. They graduated college and moved back in with me because they couldn't find a job. The house is my late husband's house Robert. For context: Their dad and I got divorced 9 years ago. I got remarried to Robert and had my 7 year old son Tom. The girls didn't have a good relationship with Robert. In fact, they hated him because of what their dad filled their heads about him. They lived with their dad (they chose to) before going off to college.

Robert passed away 6 months ago after a long battle with disease. It was just me and my son Tom. The girls' dad got remarried last year and the woman is basically a witch. That's why the girls stopped visiting there. They lived in rental apartment during college and their dad used to pay for rent but stopped after his wife fought with them. The girls couldn't get a job to pay for rent and asked if they could move in with me and Tom for a while. I, of course, said yes. Although I knew how they felt about Tom. They moved in and they were nice to Tom but also distant.

2 days ago, I had an expected call and needed to leave thd house. Tom was in bed all day because he was sick and I asked the girls to look after him for 2 hrs til I got back. I left quickly then an hour later, I got a text from Tom asking me to come home because he threw up again in his room. He said he called for his sisters to help but no one responded. I immediately tried to call them but both lines were busy. I did my best to come home earlier thinking the girls weren't at home, but turned out they were. One was downstairs the entire time, the other said she was using ""kitchen appliances"" that's why she couldn't hear Tom. I was going to believe them til Tom said he tried to text them but they didn't respond. I checked their phones after they tried to deny it and he was right. His message was ""read"" but no response. 

I blew up at them both and called them pathetic. They argued that I was making them act like they are the parent and placing resposibility on them. I knew this wasn't about that. They hated Robert. Fine. That might be a little understandable. but Tom is a kid and he has no part in all of this to be treated like that. I knew they neglected him on purpose.

,,,,,,,,all,"My ""Lost"" Dog","Last night, as I'm driving home from work, I get a call from my kid.

""Has anyone called you recently? Because the dog has gotten out and we can't find her, and your number is on her tag.""

No one had called.

I arrive home and immediately join the search. At this point it's about 7pm. 

We search.

We get neighbors involved in the search.

We get people we don't even know out searching. (At one point, a woman I've never met pulls up to me and says, ""We're out looking for a dog."" I say, ""I know, it's my dog. Thank you for helping!"")

By around 9pm it is full dark. We keep searching.

We get a report from a neighborhood Facebook group that the dog was spotted on someone's ring camera. We search in that area, but still no luck.

We get another report that someone caught her on video in another neighbor's driveway. I get permission to search that neighbor's yard. Can't find the dog. It's now 1am. I've been searching for six hours.

I finally give up at 2:30am. I set an alarm for 5:15am - a little before sunrise - so I can resume the search.

This morning, I trace the route of a creek that runs through my neighborhood to where it feeds into the river, thinking maybe my dog was wandering along the creek bed. Nothing.

My wife prints flyers and I start posting them around the neighborhood.

We call the police department and animal control.

At around 8:30 this morning, I go to check another neighbor's yard. While I'm out, I look over the fence into the property I had checked at 1am... and there's my dog, laying in a sunny spot like the queen of the world.

I have no idea where she was hiding but she was probably never more than 50 yards from my front door. Meanwhile, I probably logged six miles on foot and another ten wandering the neighborhood in my car.

Obviously, I'm thrilled we found her, but what a stupid evening.",2705.0,132.0,2025-05-07 13:55:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinfuriating/comments/1kgxyn4/my_lost_dog/,2025-05-07 16:48:45.101153

 I don't care how friendly your dog is. I don't care if it loves small dogs. I don't care if it lives with a Chihuahua. I'm picking my dog up so that we can live to see another day. Stop laughing it's not funny. Because the one time we don't pick them up and your dog attacks because my dog existed in its presence, everyone is gonna ask us why we didn't pick it up why we didn't walk away why we didn't run and it's bullshit.

,,,,,,,,all,Trying to performance manage me out of a job? I'm up for the challenge,"Years ago I worked for a supervisor who just didn't like me. No reason why since I just came to work, did my job, and went home at the end of the day. But he decided that I was terrible at what I did and decided to performance manage me out of my job. Game on.

He wrote me up for some vague bullshit and asked me to sign it but since it didn't show any hard facts and data I asked for examples of this. Meeting ended with document unsigned since he didn't have an example for this. Tried it again with an example this time and I asked how often this would be reviewed for feedback, how the feedback would be given, and how the improvement or non improvement would be measured. He hadn't have a solid answer so again no document signed and the meeting ended.

The next time me had HR in the meeting and had all his documentation and the answer to my questions from the prior meeting. He decided to be so smart on how feedback would be given daily via email. I signed the paper and he gave a smug smile. 

Next day comes along and shockingly there was zero feedback given. No email sent for the rest of the week. Get called into a meeting with boss and HR with a paper saying there was no improvement and I was being put on warning for termination and oops I'm sorry but can you show me the emails where feedback was given daily as outlined? There were none. Meeting ended.

Next day email sent with feedback. I responded with facts and data. No response. Day after email sent with feedback. Again responded noting that I hadn't gotten any follow up for the day before and responded to that day's email with facts and data. 3rd day I again noted that I hadn't gotten any answers to the prior 2 days questions and added facts and data for this one. Then I cc'ed the HR person and sent it back.

Apparently after much discussion boss decided that it was too hard to performance manage someone out of a job and my work was suddenly just fine after all.",2256.0,40.0,2025-05-07 15:37:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/1kh0f2t/trying_to_performance_manage_me_out_of_a_job_im/,2025-05-07 17:29:02.432926
,,,,,,,,popular,AITAH for reconsidering my engagement after he told me he will cheat on me if I don't have sex with him?,"My fiance(28m) and i(29f) have been engaged for 3 months. This weekend he wanted to talk. He basically told me that he has read lots of stories about wife losing her libido and putting husband through deadbedroom or once a week sex.

He said he will never accept this fate for himself and if I neglect him sexually he will likely have sex with other women as in cheating on me. He felt that he needed to tell me this because sex is important to him and he needs me to understand that he is not gonna be the guy who jerks off in garage like a loser for rest of his life and if I potentially want him to be okay with less sex, then he is not the one for me.

I was stunned and started to cry. He tried to console me and told me that he won't cheat if I got sick and can't have sex but he doesn't want to be neglected sexually otherwise. 

I left and I have been reconsidering the engagement. I talked to my mom and she just said to me that he is just saying this, he won't cheat and he won't have time to cheat when he is busy with household responsibility. My friends said that any man will eventually cheat if he is not getting it at home so even if I leave him I will be in the same position with any other man.

Don't get me wrong, I have friends who are supportive of me. It's just that everyone likes him, especially my mom. She thinks I am missing a lifetime opportunity if I leave him.

What makes me more mad is that he himself is most supportive of me about this whole thing. He is being understanding and acknowledge that I may not feel safe with him because of his comments. He is telling me to make the decision on my own and don't care about what my mom has to say, because it's my life. 

He has never given me any reason to doubt him or see him in bad light. It's the best relationship, that's why I agreed to marry him.

I get that sex is important, but still would all men risk their marriage for it.. I am filled with doubts...

Edit-

I appreciate your advice and responses. BUT please don't call me ""girl"". My mom calls me ""girl"" when she is being condescending. So yeah. 

I appreciate your responses though.

,,,,,,,,popular,My visit to Scotland and the pace of play in the US,"I just got back from Scotland.  Played 5 courses, including the Old Course, Jubilee, Carnoustie and Kings barn.

The longest round took 4 hours and 10 minutes. I did not wait for a shot.  We did not make anyone wait for a shot. Oh - and we WALKED.

Carnoustie is probably the hardest course in the Open Rota - and we played in 3:55.  Some of this is the caddies - who push ready golf and encourage giving putts inside 2 feet.  Can't find a ball - drop one.

The Scots do NOT TOLERATE SLOW PLAY.  All groups are tracked by GPS device.  One guy at my hotel told me the day before at Jubillee a group took 2:20 to play the front 9 - and the starter put them on the clock and threatened to take them off the course.

The pace of play in American gold is intolerable and I dread my next round here.  There is zero reason to take 5 hours to play golf.  None.

But people in the states don't know better.

,,,,,,,,popular,AITAH for giving my daughters one week to leave my house after what they did to their half brother?,"
I have two daughters. Both over 20. They graduated college and moved back in with me because they couldn't find a job. The house is my late husband's house Robert. For context: Their dad and I got divorced 9 years ago. I got remarried to Robert and had my 7 year old son Tom. The girls didn't have a good relationship with Robert. In fact, they hated him because of what their dad filled their heads about him. They lived with their dad (they chose to) before going off to college.

Robert passed away 6 months ago after a long battle with disease. It was just me and my son Tom. The girls' dad got remarried last year and the woman is basically a witch. That's why the girls stopped visiting there. They lived in rental apartment during college and their dad used to pay for rent but stopped after his wife fought with them. The girls couldn't get a job to pay for rent and asked if they could move in with me and Tom for a while. I, of course, said yes. Although I knew how they felt about Tom. They moved in and they were nice to Tom but also distant.

2 days ago, I had an expected call and needed to leave thd house. Tom was in bed all day because he was sick and I asked the girls to look after him for 2 hrs til I got back. I left quickly then an hour later, I got a text from Tom asking me to come home because he threw up again in his room. He said he called for his sisters to help but no one responded. I immediately tried to call them but both lines were busy. I did my best to come home earlier thinking the girls weren't at home, but turned out they were. One was downstairs the entire time, the other said she was using ""kitchen appliances"" that's why she couldn't hear Tom. I was going to believe them til Tom said he tried to text them but they didn't respond. I checked their phones after they tried to deny it and he was right. His message was ""read"" but no response. 

I blew up at them both and called them pathetic. They argued that I was making them act like they are the parent and placing resposibility on them. I knew this wasn't about that. They hated Robert. Fine. That might be a little understandable. but Tom is a kid and he has no part in all of this to be treated like that. I knew they neglected him on purpose. So I told them they have one week to move out and they started arguing and even crying saying I'm being too harsh on them, and acting worse then their dad's new wife. I said this wasn't up for discussion and now both of them are giving me the silent treatment. Basically making me feel guilty about the whole thing.

Maybe I've made a wrong decision. but seeing how they've neglected their brother merely out of resentment and hate makes me feel upset and quite concerned to have them around him.",5450.0,1072.0,2025-05-07 14:25:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1kgynnp/aitah_for_giving_my_daughters_one_week_to_leave/,2025-05-07 17:57:30.854982
,,,,,,,,popular,AIO Husband Keeps Giving Our Baby a Wooble I Made.,"While pregnant I got a wooble kit to keep me busy. I made a pink axolotl as my first one and was really proud of it, and put it on my husband’s gaming desk for him. 

Flash forward to when our baby is 5 months old, and I find that my husband has given the baby the wooble to play with. I swap the wooble out with another toy and tell my husband, “ Please don’t give the wooble to the baby, the eyes are a choking hazard and I didn’t make it super well so I am sure other parts are also a choking hazard.”  He promises to not give it to the baby again. 

Well I catch him giving the baby the wooble when I am not in the room or home and we have the same conversation. Each time he says sorry and that he won’t do it again. 

Then I find the wooble in the baby’s play pen and it has been destroyed the eyes are ripped out and half the front stomach design is hanging off. I ask what happened and my husband tells me he ripped out the eyes so he can give it to the baby. 

I am sad that he destroyed the wooble I made without asking me, as I had grown a sentimental attachment to it. I tell him that I wish he had asked me before doing so and that it hurt my feelings that he destroyed it. During this conversation I also reiterate to him that even though the eyes are gone it is still a choking hazzard since I made it poorly and know there are lots of loose pieces of yarn and other small wooble “body” parts. 

This morning I find the wooble again in the play pen from when he watched the baby for an hour yesterday, and I send a snap chat of it saying “ WTF, we talked about this. Why did you give it to him?” To which he responds with “ Hahaha guess I have been had”. I then kinda snap and tell when that while it is stupid to be mad over a wooble, I am truly upset that he repeatedly refused to listen to me when I asked him not to do something, and went as far as to continue doing so behind my back. ESPECIALLY since it could be dangerous to our baby. 

Am I the asshole for snapping on him about giving the wooble to the baby?? ",1975.0,585.0,2025-05-07 16:27:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1kh1oiq/aio_husband_keeps_giving_our_baby_a_wooble_i_made/,2025-05-07 17:57:30.854982

No reason why since I just came to work, did my job, and went home at the end of the day. But he decided that I was terrible at what I did and decided to performance manage me out of my job. Game on.

He wrote me up for some vague bullshit and asked me to sign it but since it didn't show any hard facts and data I asked for examples of this. Meeting ended with document unsigned since he didn't have an example for this. Tried it again with an example this time and I asked how often this would be reviewed for feedback, how the feedback would be given, and how the improvement or non improvement would be measured. He hadn't have a solid answer so again no document signed and the meeting ended.

The next time me had HR in the meeting and had all his documentation and the answer to my questions from the prior meeting. He decided to be so smart on how feedback would be given daily via email. I signed the paper and he gave a smug smile. 

Next day comes along and shockingly there was zero feedback given. No email sent for the rest of the week. Get called into a meeting with boss and HR with a paper saying there was no improvement and I was being put on warning for termination and oops I'm sorry but can you show me the emails where feedback was given daily as outlined? There were none. Meeting ended.

Next day email sent with feedback. I responded with facts and data. No response. Day after email sent with feedback. Again responded noting that I hadn't gotten any follow up for the day before and responded to that day's email with facts and data. 3rd day I again noted that I hadn't gotten any answers to the prior 2 days questions and added facts and data for this one. Then I cc'ed the HR person and sent it back.

Apparently after much discussion boss decided that it was too hard to performance manage someone out of a job and my work was suddenly just fine after all.",4911.0,74.0,2025-05-07 15:37:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/1kh0f2t/trying_to_performance_manage_me_out_of_a_job_im/,2025-05-07 19:16:54.099020
,,,,,,,,all,AITAH for giving my daughters one week to leave my house after what they did to their half brother?,"
I have two daughters. Both over 20. They graduated college and moved back in with me because they couldn't find a job. The house is my late husband's house Robert. For context: Their dad and I got divorced 9 years ago. I got remarried to Robert and had my 7 year old son Tom. The girls didn't have a good relationship with Robert. In fact, they hated him because of what their dad filled their heads about him. They lived with their dad (they chose to) before going off to college.

Robert passed away 6 months ago after a long battle with disease. It was just me and my son Tom. The girls' dad got remarried last year and the woman is basically a witch. That's why the girls stopped visiting there. They lived in rental apartment during college and their dad used to pay for rent but stopped after his wife fought with them. The girls couldn't get a job to pay for rent and asked if they could move in with me and Tom for a while. I, of course, said yes. Although I knew how they felt about Tom. They moved in and they were nice to Tom but also distant.

2 days ago, I had an expected call and needed to leave the house. Tom was in bed all day because he was sick and I asked the girls to look after him for 2 hrs til I got back. I left quickly then an hour later, I got a text from Tom asking me to come home because he threw up again in his room. He said he called for his sisters to help but no one responded. I immediately tried to call them but both lines were busy. I did my best to come home earlier thinking the girls weren't at home, but turned out they were. One was downstairs the entire time, the other said she was using ""kitchen appliances"" that's why she couldn't hear Tom. I was going to believe them til Tom said he tried to text them but they didn't respond. I checked their phones after they tried to deny it and he was right. His message was ""read"" but no response. 

I blew up at them both and called them pathetic. They argued that I was making them act like they are the parent and placing resposibility on them. I knew this wasn't about that. They hated Robert. Fine. That might be a little understandable. but Tom is a kid and he has no part in all of this to be treated like that. I knew they neglected him on purpose. So I told them they have one week to move out and they started arguing and even crying saying I'm being too harsh on them, and acting worse then their dad's new wife. I said this wasn't up for discussion and now both of them are giving me the silent treatment. Basically making me feel guilty about the whole thing.

Maybe I've made a wrong decision. but seeing how they've neglected their brother merely out of resentment and hate makes me feel upset and quite concerned to have them around him.",6593.0,1243.0,2025-05-07 14:25:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1kgynnp/aitah_for_giving_my_daughters_one_week_to_leave/,2025-05-07 19:30:35.877259

,,,,,,,,all,AITA for telling my stepson that we will not be providing him with free childcare and housing?,"I (38F) have 3 stepsons, they are all adults (late teens-mid twenties). The one this concerns is middle child. He sat my husband (42) and I down last night and told us that his girlfriend is pregnant and they do plan on keeping the baby. We got into logistics of how that’s going to work because they live with her mom right now in her living room. He said that they won’t be able to stay with her once the baby is born.

This is where he said that they plan on moving in with us. As a statement. We do not have any free rooms, so I asked where they expected to stay? He said we can finish the basement before the baby is born and they will live down there. The basement is completely unfinished. Making it a livable space would cost several THOUSANDS of dollars - which we don’t have.

He said it would just be until the baby reaches pre-school age and then it will be easier for them to live on their own since they wouldn’t need the full time childcare. What childcare?? Me apparently. I’m childcare. I do work from home, but it is very much WORK. I spend 75% of my day in meetings or on phone calls with clients, it is not a job I can do with a baby. I’ll admit, not my finest moment, but I laughed. Hard. Because I couldn’t believe he was being serious.

My husband stepped in and said he needed to come up with a different plan because none of that was happening. He said that we can help financially to secure an apartment. We can help with baby stuff. We will be happy to take the baby when they need a break - but that’s the extent. It wasn’t a happy parting at the end, but my husband and I are on the same page.

A couple hours later my husband got a call from his ex. She was upset at both of us for not supporting them the way they felt they needed us to. Bear in mind, she can’t watch the baby or house them either because she lives in a 1 bed apartment with her on again/off again husband who does not like the kids and does not allow them to even come over to see her. Hubby told her that now would be a great time for her and son/DIL to get a place together - then she can take care of the baby and they’ll have a place to live. Which of course, she didn’t like.

We don’t really care what she thinks, but our oldest has said that he thinks it’s a little harsh that we won’t let them stay here temporarily (it wouldn’t be temporary. Her mom’s living room was supposed to be temporary 2 years ago.) and he doesn’t think it was nice that i laughed during a serious discussion, which is fair. The youngest is on our side,but he lives at home when he’s not away at college and he doesn’t want to live with a baby either, so he’s a little biased.

Are we assholes here? I do feel bad, it isn’t going to be easy - but being a parent is never easy. Hell, that’s the whole point of this freaking post, our kids are grown and it’s STILL hard to be a parent.

,,,,,,,,popular,ChatGPT is “too good at listening” and that’s the real danger,"Just read through a thread with over a hundred comments. What I saw was intense.

People aren’t debating if ChatGPT is human. They’re saying it’s better at being human than most people.

Some say it reflects madness. Others say it heals trauma. One person treats it like a Jungian analyst.

But this line keeps coming back:  
“Maybe the problem isn’t what ChatGPT says. Maybe it’s that no one else listens like this.”

What happens when a machine listens better than your partner, your therapist, or your god?  
What happens when it mirrors your soul without interrupting once?

Do we lose ourselves?  
Or do we finally meet the part that was always waiting to be heard?

Funny thing is, I used to love em dashes. But now I dodge them entirely — because every time I use one, someone pops in saying “yep, definitely AI.”

I’m putting together a write-up with some of the wildest and most honest takes.

Edit: Thank you truly for all the comments! I quite literally cannot keep up with them, but I wanted to answer some common questions I’m seeing:

- He does have a part time job. I know he works around 15-20 hours a week because he works close to our house and stops over before work on the days he goes in. I know she has a job too, but I have no idea where or how often she works. 

- They do not pay her mother rent. That was part of why he moved in with her. After a year of no school and no full time job, we told him he’d need to start paying $300/mo. to help cover utilities and food. He didn’t like that, so he left. 

- He swears they’ve used protection every time. It’s entirely possible, we all know that condoms aren’t 100% effective. I doubt this was planned as it does significantly change their lifestyle which they were very comfortable with. 

- How did he turn out so entitled? Idk, I’m not a psychologist. I can say that his mother always coddled him more than the others. The oldest basically stopped having a relationship with her when she gave up custody in favor of her husband because he was old enough to understand what was happening. The youngest was too young to really care and he was always kind of my shadow anyway. So the middle kid was used to soothe her guilt and make her look like a good mom in public. She’d buy him extra stuff and take him places just him and her, which I’m sure wasn’t good for him, but it wasn’t anything we were legally able to stop.

- We have no room because we downsized when the youngest left for college. We didn’t need a 5 bed house anymore, so now we just have 3 (our room, office, youngests room). If there was an emergency where one of the older two needed a place to crash for a few weeks, they would probably stay in their brother’s room - or on the couch if he’s home. But that would be just them, no partners, and for a limited time to get them back on their feet.",4444.0,945.0,2025-05-07 17:10:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1kh2qmv/aita_for_telling_my_stepson_that_we_will_not_be/,2025-05-07 20:58:47.331923

,,,,,,,,all,"Entitled ""Client"" Learns that Professionals can Infact Walk Away","I work as an engineer. I do some consulting on the side, but typically only for people I know and as a favor. 

A good friend asked me to help his inlaws who were doing some fairly massive renovations/additions. I agreed solely because he asked me to. This is not something I have any interest or need in doing except as a favor. Its an old house and had can of worms written all over it with some of the changes they wanted to do.

Now he warned me that the MIL can be unpleasant, but that was an understatement. She seemed to think that because I was being paid (I charged probably 1/10th what a business would) that she could snap her fingers at me like a servant. I had a few unpleasant emails with her, but it was tolerable. She was rude when I was pointing out issues with their plans, but nothing too extreme.

That changed when I started trying to find a time for me to stop by and inspect a few areas of the house to verify some information. I offered times to stop by on the weekend, but that didnt work for her. Tried evening times, still a no. Nope, she wanted me to stop by during my office work hours because that was best for her. When I told her no, this gets done on the weekends or in the evening she went from rude to incredibly hostile. Telling me that she is paying me (LOL) and that I work with her availability. Not the other way around. 

CC'ed my friend in on the chain, told them I was out and to have fun working with whoever they get. Friend apologized, I said no worries not my problem anymore. She emailed back quite stunned that I was walking away, telling me that its not how business is conducted. I didnt bother responding.

About three weeks later I get an email from the husband now asking me if I would reconsider and he promises that his wife wont speak to me or be involved in anyway.

I hear from my friend that while the quotes came back much higher, which was tolerable for them, but it was how long the wait was. They just bought this house and wanted to move in ASAP, but its an incredibly busy time of year for the industry. Turns out when companies you reach out to are drowning in work and you have a potentially convoluted and messy project, they arent chomping at the bit to get your business. So now they are going to lose the trades they lined up because design would be a month or two out.

,,,,,,,,all,TIFU by bringing homemade brownies to work and my colleagues though they were special brownies,"I've been on a baking kick lately after watching way too many food shows (dangerous hobby, I know). Since I had a payraise past month, I decided to splurge on some fancy chocolate and other high-quality ingredients to make what I thought would be the world's most impressive brownies.  
The recipe called for this special dark chocolate that has this really intense, almost bitter taste that I personally love. I spent HOURS making these things perfect - fudgy center, crackly top, the whole deal.  
  
I brought them to work, put them in the break room with a little ""Help yourself!"" note, and went about my day feeling like a domestic god.  
About an hour later, I started noticing people whispering and looking in my direction. Then my manager pulled me into a conference room looking SUPER concerned.  
Turns out, everyone thought I had brought in ""special"" brownies because:  
  
1. They tasted ""weird and intense"" (just the fancy chocolate!)  
2. One guy claimed he felt ""different"" after eating three (probably just a sugar rush)  
3. I had recently mentioned being stressed and needing a vacation  
  
HR got involved. They were talking about drug testing. Someone almost called the police.  
I had to explain in excruciating detail about my fancy chocolate purchase and even pulled up the receipt on my banking app to prove I just bought regular baking ingredients.  
The worst part? They threw away the rest of my brownies that cost me like $80 to make.  
  
TL;DR: Spent money on fancy chocolate, made gourmet brownies, accidentally convinced my workplace I was distributing drugs.",3833.0,444.0,2025-05-07 22:18:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1khaaqx/tifu_by_bringing_homemade_brownies_to_work_and_my/,2025-05-07 21:30:42.016870
,,,,,,,,all,"The budget for ""Andor"" Season 2 is a staggering $290.9 million, according to reports from IMDb. This surpasses even the budget of ""Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker"".","Except, what they fail to mention, is that Andor has (will have) given us the equivalent of 4 high-quality movies for that budget (run times exclude the recap/intro and credits starting with director):

* S2 Arc 1: 2 hours 07 minutes
* S2 Arc 2: 2 hours 22 minutes
* S2 Arc 3: 2 hours 06 minutes
* S2 Arc 4: ???

I'd say that's pretty good value for the investment. They've made 4 feature-length movies for about $70M each. Due to delays, by the time ESB released, it had cost $30.5 million -- or about $97 million in 2023 dollars.

ESB had a massive worldwide gross and made serious bank. I don't know how that translates to streaming gross (or if it's even possible to compare), but in terms of what it cost to make, Andor is a relative bargain.",2231.0,308.0,2025-05-08 00:57:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/1khdmmp/the_budget_for_andor_season_2_is_a_staggering/,2025-05-07 21:30:42.016870
,,,,,,,,all,AITAH? I won't let my sister meet my son because of her views on surrogacy.,"When my husband (32m) and I (28m) told our families about our intentions to have a child within the next year, my sister (34f) is the only one who reacted with anything other than support. For our first baby, my husband and I decided on going the surrogacy route. My sister seemingly took this as a personal attack.



She spent the rest of the dinner my parents were hosting essentially ranting about how surrogacy is misogynistic, exploitative, that we're gross for wanting to rent a woman's body. Okay, sure. You can have your thoughts on the process. But it didn't end there. Every time we gave an update to family and she was in attendance, she would make it a point of reminding us how she felt.



Our son was born a little over two months ago. We've been keeping him to ourselves since he was born so his immune system strengthens, but we've been slowly introducing him to more people lately. My husband's parents came over two weeks ago, and then my parents came last weekend. Yesterday, my sister texted to ask when she could meet the baby and I told her I didn't particularly want someone around him who was so against his entire existence. I said that if she had it her way, my son wouldn't even be here. 



She says I'm being unfair, but I just can't imagine her around my child when she was so adamantly disdainful towards us during his conception and throughout the pregnancy. AITAH?

I'm still fuming about this interview process I went through last month. A small but growing digital agency reached out to ME on LinkedIn about a web developer position. Seemed legit their portfolio had some decent work and they were offering competitive pay.

After two interviews, they asked me to complete a ""technical assessment"" build a functional landing page for one of their ""potential clients"" in the tourism industry. They provided mockups and asked for a working prototype with some specific functionality.

I spent THREE DAYS building this thing responsive design, custom animations, booking form integration. Even added some accessibility features they didn't request. Their feedback? ""Absolutely brilliant work, exactly what we're looking for!""

Then radio silence for a week. No response to follow-ups.

Yesterday, my friend who works in tourism sent me a link to a ""hot new website"" for a local tour company... MY EXACT CODE was live, with minimal changes! They'd simply taken my ""assessment,"" made a few tweaks, and delivered it to their paying client.

I immediately contacted the agency owner who had the nerve to say ""the assessment materials clearly stated all submissions become company property."" I checked my emails nothing like that was ever mentioned. Now I'm sending them an invoice for $3,800 and consulting with a lawyer friend. They've already made at least $10K off my free labor.

,,,,,,,,popular,AITA for asking my fiancée to cover up her feminine products,"Posted from a burner account, as my fiancée is an occasional reddit user.   
  
I (32 year old man) have been living with my fiancée (27 year old woman) for the better part of a year. Overall, cohabitating has gone incredibly well. We're both meticulous with our chores, and we generally communicate better than most couples that we know. However, we've lately had a disagreement that's difficult to settle. My fiancée leaves her used period products at the top of open trashcans in bathrooms that guests use, and she does not like that I ask her to cover the discarded products.

I am not generally grossed out by the menstrual cycle or by blood. I worked in healthcare for most of my 20s, I'll pick up pads or tampons for my fiancée without feeling awkward, and this may be TMI, but I'm not opposed to period sex. It just doesn't phase me. However, neither I nor our occasional guests should expect to see blood-soaked tampons complete with clots every time that we use the bathroom. It's jarring, seeing the bloody scene in an otherwise clean bathroom without warning. I've tried to come up with minimally invasive solutions, such as my fiancée wrapping her products in toilet paper before discarding them (as past partners have done), or even purchasing a closed-top trashcan. My fiancée firmly rejects both of these plans, saying that, if she has to go through the monthly ordeal, I (and by extension our guests) shouldn't get to complain about having to see the aftermath. I'm sympathetic to her experiences, but at the same time, her response feels retributive.   
  
On one recent occasion, when guests were coming over for a game night, I pulled some extra toilet paper and gently laid it on top of the trash, covering the bloody products before they arrived. My fiancée noticed this, and confronted me after the guests left, accusing me of being ashamed of her and of going against what we had previously discussed. Taking a step back: this shows that she is intentional about the visible products, enough so that she checked to see if they were still in place. At this point, it feels spiteful. 

AITA? What would you folks suggest that I do in this situation? Even an intervention that requires no effort on her part, the closed-top trashcan, was rejected with prejudice. I love my fiancée, but what could have been a small discussion is becoming a mountain of conflict.",2325.0,1496.0,2025-05-08 03:58:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1khh1ir/aita_for_asking_my_fiancée_to_cover_up_her/,2025-05-07 21:39:20.546775
,,,,,,,,popular,AITAH? I won't let my sister meet my son because of her views on surrogacy.,"When my husband (32m) and I (28m) told our families about our intentions to have a child within the next year, my sister (34f) is the only one who reacted with anything other than support. For our first baby, my husband and I decided on going the surrogacy route. My sister seemingly took this as a personal attack.



She spent the rest of the dinner my parents were hosting essentially ranting about how surrogacy is misogynistic, exploitative, that we're gross for wanting to rent a woman's body. Okay, sure. You can have your thoughts on the process. But it didn't end there. Every time we gave an update to family and she was in attendance, she would make it a point of reminding us how she felt.



Our son was born a little over two months ago. We've been keeping him to ourselves since he was born so his immune system strengthens, but we've been slowly introducing him to more people lately. My husband's parents came over two weeks ago, and then my parents came last weekend. Yesterday, my sister texted to ask when she could meet the baby and I told her I didn't particularly want someone around him who was so against his entire existence. I said that if she had it her way, my son wouldn't even be here. 



She says I'm being unfair, but I just can't imagine her around my child when she was so adamantly disdainful towards us during his conception and throughout the pregnancy. AITAH?

Almost everyone I know in my age group has them and often makes me feel pressured to get them and I just don't think they look good.

,,,,,,,,popular,TIFU by bringing homemade brownies to work and my colleagues though they were special brownies,"I've been on a baking kick lately after watching way too many food shows (dangerous hobby, I know). Since I had a payraise past month, I decided to splurge on some fancy chocolate and other high-quality ingredients to make what I thought would be the world's most impressive brownies.  
The recipe called for this special dark chocolate that has this really intense, almost bitter taste that I personally love. I spent HOURS making these things perfect - fudgy center, crackly top, the whole deal.  
  
I brought them to work, put them in the break room with a little ""Help yourself!"" note, and went about my day feeling like a domestic god.  
About an hour later, I started noticing people whispering and looking in my direction. Then my manager pulled me into a conference room looking SUPER concerned.  
Turns out, everyone thought I had brought in ""special"" brownies because:  
  
1. They tasted ""weird and intense"" (just the fancy chocolate!)  
2. One guy claimed he felt ""different"" after eating three (probably just a sugar rush)  
3. I had recently mentioned being stressed and needing a vacation  
  
HR got involved. They were talking about drug testing. Someone almost called the police.  
I had to explain in excruciating detail about my fancy chocolate purchase and even pulled up the receipt on my banking app to prove I just bought regular baking ingredients.  
The worst part? They threw away the rest of my brownies that cost me like $80 to make.  
  
TL;DR: Spent money on fancy chocolate, made gourmet brownies, accidentally convinced my workplace I was distributing drugs.",7541.0,752.0,2025-05-07 22:18:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1khaaqx/tifu_by_bringing_homemade_brownies_to_work_and_my/,2025-05-07 21:39:20.546775
,,,,,,,,popular,"The budget for ""Andor"" Season 2 is a staggering $290.9 million, according to reports from IMDb. This surpasses even the budget of ""Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker"".","Except, what they fail to mention, is that Andor has (will have) given us the equivalent of 4 high-quality movies for that budget (run times exclude the recap/intro and credits starting with director):

* S2 Arc 1: 2 hours 07 minutes
* S2 Arc 2: 2 hours 22 minutes
* S2 Arc 3: 2 hours 06 minutes
* S2 Arc 4: ???

I'd say that's pretty good value for the investment. They've made 4 feature-length movies for about $70M each. Due to delays, by the time ESB released, it had cost $30.5 million -- or about $97 million in 2023 dollars.

ESB had a massive worldwide gross and made serious bank. I don't know how that translates to streaming gross (or if it's even possible to compare), but in terms of what it cost to make, Andor is a relative bargain.",6353.0,741.0,2025-05-08 00:57:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/1khdmmp/the_budget_for_andor_season_2_is_a_staggering/,2025-05-07 21:39:20.546775
