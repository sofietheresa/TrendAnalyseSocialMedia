all,AITAH for refusing to pay my friend for a custom cake because it included something I’m allergic to?,"My (28F) friend (30F) is a self-taught baker who recently started her own small business. She’s made some great cakes in the past, and I wanted to support her, so I asked if she could make a cake for my mom’s 60th birthday. I told her I wanted something floral and elegant, and I gave her some examples. I also told her clearly that my mom is allergic to almonds like, epi-pen level allergic.

She agreed, and I paid her a $100 deposit for the $250 cake. A week later, I went to pick it up and she was so proud of it. It looked beautiful, honestly, but when I asked what flavor it was, she told me it was almond vanilla, because she thought it gave it a “more upscale taste.”

I was shocked. I reminded her my mom is allergic to almonds, and she just kind of brushed it off and said it was such a small amount and it would be fine as long as my mom didn’t eat too much. I told her I couldn’t take the cake, and she got upset, saying I was being overdramatic and ungrateful for all her hard work.

I told her she could either make a new cake or I wouldn’t be paying the rest. She refused, and now mutual friends are telling me I should’ve just accepted it and gotten a different dessert for my mom. Others say I was right not to risk it.

I didn’t mean to cause drama, but I’m honestly hurt that she ignored something so serious.

all,Lue's photo is 100% debunked.,"EDIT:

What confuses me about all of this is the sheer stupidity of it all. He worked with the CIA, he's not dumb. He *HAD TO KNOW* that showing this photo would bring the Geo-finder nuts out of the woodwork. People can be found based on single trees and birds flying in the sky ffs. He *HAD* to have known that if this thing was fake, it was going to be found. So I am left thinking that this is intentional, I guess. Because if he knew it was fake, then he had to have known it would be debunked, and that it would damage the disclosure effort. Which sucks! I like Lue. But this is just silly.

all,Do Republicans Realize It’s Not Just Democrats - The Whole World Looks at Them with Disgust,"Republicans keep acting like this is just a culture war, as if it's about DEI, immigrants, or whatever grievance of the week gets them riled up. But what they’re enabling under Trump isn’t a debate. It’s a global threat, and the rest of the world sees it clearly.

Trump has insulted allies, threatened to abandon NATO, and pulled the U.S. out of the Paris Climate Accord again. He has imposed tariffs on Canada and Germany out of spite, joked about annexing Canada, and treated diplomacy like a reality show. These are not policies. They are provocations, and they are shaking the global order.

Now he has pulled back support for Ukraine, unraveling years of unity and leaving Europe to question whether the U.S. can still be trusted.

Republicans have already made clear they don't care how this affects people here. But they seem equally indifferent to the fact that it's dragging the rest of the world down with them. Their loyalty to Trump is wrecking alliances, stalling climate action, emboldening dictators, and unraveling decades of shared progress.

To much of the world, it looks like insanity - a country sabotaging the very systems it built, while millions cheer it on like a sport. This isn’t just short-sighted. It's a betrayal of everything we once stood for, both at home and abroad. The world is not confused. They're disgusted. And they’re right to be.


Edit:

I just realized every so-called right-wing reply in this sub comes from a negative karma troll account. Seriously check accounts - negative 60, negative 100, every time. Are you guys bots, trolls, or just Republicans who can’t post from a real profile? You need a burner just to spread MAGA filth? This is crazy.

popular,Am I the only one who thinks the Trump “ear shot” was a staged political stunt to humanize him before the election?,"Okay, bear with me. I know this sounds like conspiracy territory — but the more I think about it, the more it *doesn't* sit right.

Let’s look at the facts:

* **The timing?** Impeccable. Right when his campaign was floundering in terms of public sympathy and momentum, he suddenly becomes a “survivor” of a *failed assassination attempt*. Cue media frenzy, rally cries, and instant victim-turned-hero energy.
* **The injury?** His *ear*. Not lethal. Not life-threatening. But *just enough* to be dramatic. It leaves a visible mark without disabling him — the perfect setup for a comeback photo op.
* **The effect?** People who previously saw him as reckless or power-hungry are suddenly seeing a “human” side. A wounded man, supposedly targeted just for telling the truth. It reframes him as the underdog — even a martyr — and historically, those narratives win elections.
* **The rollout?** Way too polished. Speeches, videos, statements — all ready to go like it was part of a campaign strategy. There wasn’t panic, there was *production*.

This feels like a play right out of the authoritarian PR handbook: **create chaos, survive it publicly, and watch your approval ratings climb.** We've seen this tactic before — it's manipulative, emotional propaganda masked as “patriotism.”

I'm not saying it *definitely* was staged — but I’m saying it’s a hell of a lot more convenient than it is convincing.

Curious if anyone else had this gut reaction, or if I’m alone on this hill.

Posts like this should absolutely be flagged and investigated by federal authorities. Under Title 18 U.S. Code § 871, threatening the President is a federal crime, and anyone crossing that line should face prosecution. This isn’t protected speech—it’s a direct threat to national leadership.

If found guilty, they should face the full weight of the law. While treason, as defined in the Constitution, is a specific and narrow charge, actions that promote violence against the government can lead to serious consequences, including imprisonment.

Calls for harm aren’t “opinions”—they’re criminal acts, and it’s time we stop tolerating them under the guise of free speech. AI should be used to track these cowards down, identify them, and bring them to justice. If they hate this country so much, maybe El Salvador or GITMO is exactly where they belong.

popular,AITAH for kicking out my gf's sister and her kids out of my flat after my gf gave her the keys,"People around me are saying I am an AH but I need the perspective of uninvolved people.  
My long term gf has my apartment keys, as I have hers. Only unspoken until now but always respected rule was, if you need to go to the other place, just send a text ""Hey going to your place"". Doesn't matter if the other is at home or even responds. Just simply to tell the other you will be at their place.  
  
I was supposed to be away 700km from home for 2 weeks for work related stuff, but 4 days in and our instructor got into an accident. Work tried to find another one, but no such luck on very short notice. They decided at like 10pm to get us the 1st flight home the next day at like 6am, pay us the overtime and the next day at home, then resume our normal work schedule.  
So I get home the next day at like 9am, sent a text to my gf to tell her I am back.  
Getting to my door, I am very confused hearing children screaming inside since none of the people who have my keys have low kids like that (my brother and my gf). I thought I got squatters or something. Opening the door and I see my gf's sister's kid running around after a shower, putting water everywhere. Plates of half finished ravioli on my living room ground. Their suitcases opened in the entrance.  
  
I get inside and see the husband on my couch trying to hook up my PS2(that he must have digged out in my storage room). Getting into a verbal argument with him trying to understand why the fuck they are here. Said my gf told them they could get my flat for 2 weeks while I was gone (they wanted to visit the city for a bit, go to the beach). My gf sent me a text while i was arguing, telling me ""oh ok, btw my sis fam' is at your flat"".  
  
I admit I blew up on him and the sis who left my bedroom in the meantime. Told them to leave immediately. They argued quite a bit, my gf called her sis, then sis put up the speaker so we could all hear, and she said I was embarrassing her, that she told them they could use my place for a while.  
  
I threatened to call the police, also asked my brothers to come.  
They left while cursing me to their children, telling that holidays are over because the mean little sister's boyfriend cast us out.  
I have now all of my gf family on my back, and even some of my own family, saying i could have stayed with at my gf so the kids could have some vacations...  
  
Also. They have read my doctor prescription papers(I put them in a specific order, and it was not the same), and obviously took some of my prescribed meds (opened a box of benzodiazepine...).  
  
AITAH for making them leave?
We pretty much stopped talking about anything else with my gf. I feel like i am being gaslighted. I would never invite people to her apartment like that, especially without telling her. It seems so disrespectful.

popular,AITA for not caring that my husband sleeps with other women even though we’re married?,"I (26F) have been married to my husband (38M) for four years. We have two young kids together (M2) and a (F10 months) When we got together, he was very upfront with me about the fact that he doesn’t believe in strict monogamy. He’s always been honest that he sometimes wants to sleep with other women, and I agreed to it under the condition that he’d always be open and respectful about it  no lying, no sneaking around.

It’s not for everyone, I get that. But for us, it works. I’m not the jealous type, and emotionally, we’re very connected. He’s a great dad, really involved, and we live comfortably. He owns a few businesses and does very well financially  We live in a nice big house in a gated neighborhood,and ate able to travel whenever we want and I’ve been able to stay home with the kids without worrying about money.

The issue started last week when my cousin saw him out at a bar with another woman. She apparently recognized him, took a photo, and sent it to my sister. My sister immediately called me in a panic, saying “he’s cheating on you,” and when I told her that I already knew and that it’s not a secret, she completely flipped.

She said I was “letting myself be disrespected” and “hurting my kids” by staying in a marriage like this. She went off about how I’m setting a horrible example and even said, “If you don’t tell Mom and Dad, I will.”

I tried to explain that it’s something we agreed on and that our kids are safe, loved, and have both parents present. But she’s acting like I’m being brainwashed or manipulated. I honestly don’t see the issue. This is our agreement, and it doesn’t affect how we raise our children or how we function as a family.

Now I’m stuck with this anxiety about my family finding out and judging me, even though I’m genuinely okay with the arrangement. I feel like they’re projecting their values onto my marriage and not even trying to understand that different relationships can work in different ways.

popular,I (34m) house sit for other people with the specific goal of going through their things.,"So I’ve been a house sitter/dog watcher for a number of years. It’s truly easy money. I’m excellent at what I do. Odds are your place will be cleaner than when you left for your vacation or work trip. I’ll collect your mail and organize it by the date it was delivered, wash all my towels and bed sheets, never have guest over, etc, etc. However unknown to you and every person who has let me house sit. I’m going to go through your things. Specifically your clothes. Mainly just your clothes. I’ll open and go through every closet, and open and go through all your drawers. Dresses, suits, bathing suits, sweaters, pants, skirts, underwear, scarves, jackets, hosiery, hats, you own it, I’m going to take a look. If I really like something, if it really catches my eye or gets my heart going, I’ll try it on. I’ll stand in front of your mirror and see how it fits me. I’ll wear it around the house and see how it feels. Especially if you’re married woman, for some reason your things in particular I love to look through and wear.

Yes the thrill is doing something I’m not supposed to be doing and the thrill of possibly getting caught in your sexiest outfit. But mainly, if you thought it was nice enough to buy and wear, I want to see why. When I’m done, I’ll fold it back up, or hang it exactly how I found it. You never know. How do I know, because you’ve asked me to house sit again and again and again.

It started when I was back in high school. My friends would have a party, and when everyone was outside, I’d go upstairs and see what their mom had tucked away, then I’d try it on see how I looked, the fold it back and put it away like nothing ever happened. Then I started house sitting, and found out I could have free reign and not have to sneak around.

I’m sure this all sounds incredibly creepy, and like a breach of trust, I’m not looking for advice, just wanted to get it off my chest.

popular,AITAH for telling my husband I’d rather raise a kid who stands up for themselves than one who blindly obeys?,"I’m 32F, my husband is 31M. We have a 6yrs old son, Leo. He’s a sweet, curious kid who’s really into dinosaurs and loves riding his little blue bike.

Last weekend, I went grocery shopping while my husband stayed home with Leo. Apparently, Leo was outside riding his bike and left it in the front yard while he went inside to get water. A few minutes later, our neighbor, Ms. Robert, came over saying her grandson (8M) saw Leo take his bike. My husband looked out, didn’t see Leo’s bike, and assumed the worst.

He confronted Leo, who insisted he didn’t steal anything. He said his bike was gone. My husband didn’t believe him and told him he was grounded, no TV, no tablet until he told the truth and apologized.

Leo refused, saying, “I didn’t take anyone’s bike! Why are you punishing me when I didn’t do anything?”

Later that afternoon, Ms. Robert returned, visibly embarrassed. Turns out her grandson had taken Leo’s bike to the park because he thought it looked cooler. He made the whole story up to avoid getting in trouble.

When I got home, my husband explained the situation. I figured, “Okay, you’ll apologize to Leo and this will be a learning moment.” But nope he doubled down. He said Leo still needed to be punished for “disrespect” and “refusing to obey.”

I said, “So you want to punish him for telling the truth and standing up for himself?”

He said, “It’s the principle. He needs to listen, even when he doesn’t agree.”

And I said, “I’d rather raise a boy who knows how to stand up for himself than one who just lays down and accepts mistreatment. Especially when he’s innocent.”

We got into a pretty heated argument. He says I’m being unreasonable and dramatic and undermining him as a parent.

But I don’t think I’m wrong for wanting to teach my son that it’s okay to say no when something is unfair, even if it’s coming from a parent.

trendingreddits,How To Guide | The Smart Blogger’s Path to a Steady Online Income,"Blogging isn’t dead—it’s evolved. What once began as an online journal has grown into a powerful tool for building authority, growing an audience, and generating sustainable income. Whether you’re a solopreneur, side hustler, or small business owner, blogging is still one of the smartest ways to earn online. But success doesn’t come overnight—it takes strategy, consistency, and knowing what works today.

In this guide, we’ll break down the path smart bloggers take to turn their writing into a steady source of income—and how you can do the same.

Why Blogging Still Works in 2025
Despite the explosion of video content and social media, blogging continues to thrive. Why? Because search engines still prioritize quality written content. People turn to Google every day with questions, and blogs that offer valuable answers continue to rise to the top.

According to a HubSpot study, businesses that blog get 55% more website visitors than those that don’t. This is especially important for American entrepreneurs looking to build authority in competitive niches.

Real-World Example: NerdWallet
NerdWallet, a personal finance company, built its multi-million-dollar brand primarily through blogging. By publishing SEO-optimized content that answered common money questions, it attracted millions of readers—and converted them into users of its affiliate partners and services.

trendingreddits,How to Prepare Americans for Upcoming Job Loss Due to AI,"As artificial intelligence (AI) continues to evolve, it’s becoming increasingly clear that its impact on the workforce will be profound. While AI promises greater efficiency, lower costs, and new industries, it also poses a significant threat to many traditional jobs—especially those involving repetitive, rule-based tasks. For Americans, the challenge ahead isn’t just technological—it’s personal, economic, and cultural.


What Jobs Are Most at Risk?
Let’s be honest — it’s the working class that’s getting hit first.
Not all jobs are equally vulnerable to AI automation. Roles that involve routine, repetitive tasks are the most at risk. So how can workers prepare for the AI-driven transformation of the labor market? Here’s a look at what’s coming, and what can be done about it. These include:

Administrative support (data entry, payroll, scheduling)

Transportation (drivers, delivery)

Retail and customer service

Basic manufacturing and warehouse jobs

Even white-collar jobs in finance, legal services, and journalism are starting to see AI encroach on tasks like report writing, contract analysis, and data interpretation.

Who emerged to find Jesus. Who was written off as a has-been by the end of the '80s and who suddenly shifted gears, releasing some of the strongest music of his career beginning in the late '90s.

Ladies and gentlemen — Columbia recording artist Bob Dylan!

popular,I don’t miss smithing,"People who have also come here from Skyrim, do you agree? 

Surprisingly I don’t miss smithing at all, actually quite the opposite. Without the ability to forge all of my own weapons and armor, suddenly I’m vastly more invested and immersed in the open world again! I’m dungeon delving looking for loot, or actually visiting vendors with purpose, not just to dump billions of iron daggers. 

When I find a new piece of gear in a chest or at a vendor, it’s exciting and I actually use it. I can’t remember the last time I ever did this in Skyrim, because I can just make everything myself and it’s super easy to do and super easy to do early on. I now realise this was extremely isolating and takes a lot of interactivity out of the open world. 

This might be a very controversial take but playing Oblivion makes me realise that I wouldn’t want smithing in ES6, or if they do include it, a remade version of it. Maybe the materials are harder to come by or require deep specialisation to craft; or maybe it’s limited to upgrading only - so you still have to visit merchants and explore dungeons. 

Obviously I still explored dungeons in Skyrim but I never really did it for gear loot. 

Just me or do you agree? ",4057,726,2025-05-01 23:50:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1kcna8y/i_dont_miss_smithing/,2025-05-02 12:02:38.029249
all,That time a neighborhood kid got even on the asshole delivery guy,"This one happened a few years ago. Our mail carrier changed and the new guy (call him Dave) was an absolute asshole. Trod on flowerbeds, rude to people. But the real kicker was Dave would pee in a bottle and if he was in a bad mood, that bottle would be thrown in someone's garden. If you tell him to throw the bottle in the trash, he'd throw it at you. Dave was the son of the postmaster (Bob), an older guy of the ""boys will be boys"" mind set, and best friends with the local Sherrif (Steve). If you talked to Bob about his son, it'd be excuses. He's a foster kid, he's had a hard life, and on and on. If you went to Steve then it'd be ""boys will be boys"" (Dave was in his 30s) or ""Postmaster Bob is dealing with it personally"".

One day in the middle of summer the neighborhood kids got to see Mailman Dave being his usual sunny self. Seems Dave was mean to them too. The kids were out playing with their water pistols and one of them had this real high-power thing which sent the water a good ten feet or more - and the kid who owned it (Orrin) was a great shot. It's a lovely day, 30 degree sun and I'm out back putting out dinner.

Suddenly there's this blood-curdling scream from Dave and the whole neighborhood comes running to see what happened. Turns out Orrin had loaded his water pistol with one of Dave's pee bottles, and topped it off with a can of Red Bull. So now Dave was covered in this disgusting, sticky, pee-and-sugar mess, which was starting to stink to high heaven. One of my neighbors offered to let Dave use her shower, he ran off to another house, grabbed the hose and turns it on himself. So now Dave is sticky, pee-soaked and wet. He ditched everything in the street and ran off.

Steve and Bob went walking the street that afternoon, we'd all ""not seen anything"" of course. Bob had the bright idea of asking Orrin, who told him exactly what we all thought of Dave and how he was acting, in the way only a bright-eyed twelve-year-old can.

Bob and Steve cornered Orrin's dad. ""Is this your son?! Do you know what he did?!""  
Without missing a beat, Orrin's dad fired back. ""Well, Sherrif Steve, don't you always say 'boys will be boys'?""

We never saw Dave again. But Orrin's birthday party was huge that year.

God bless that kid.",1092,25,2025-05-02 10:08:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1kcxb46/that_time_a_neighborhood_kid_got_even_on_the/,2025-05-02 12:07:38.411233
