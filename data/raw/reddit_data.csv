books,"I want to buy new books at the book fair and bookstore. But someone asked me ""Have you finished the old books you bought last time?"" What is a logical response to this or how can I justify buying new books even though I still have many unread ones (1000+ books) ?","In Japanese, there's a word for people who buy books but don’t read them “Tsundoku” (積ん読) (not to be confused with ""Sudoku"", that is my favorite game). In Thai “กองดอง” (Kong Dong) refers to a pile or collection of things that are accumulated but not used or processed. In French, “Bibliomanie” refers to an obsession with collecting books, sometimes to the point of hoarding them without actually reading them. In German, “Lesestapel” is a term for a pile of books meant to be read but it often implies they might not be. In English I think sometimes the word ""Lazy"" fits me.

I buy books all the time. At book fairs, in bookstores and even online, I’m always finding something interesting something that calls out to me. Sometimes I read and finish them (I read around 52 books a year). Sometimes I start and stop halfway and sometimes I don’t even take the book out of the bag. By now I probably own more than 1000+ unread books. So how do I justify buying more books when I still have so many unread ones?",213,357,2025-04-06 12:48:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1jsre8z/i_want_to_buy_new_books_at_the_book_fair_and/

books,I read I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings by Maya Angelou and found a new role model to look up to,"I've decided to start reading more non-fiction books this year. Stories of real people always fascinated me and it's always amazing to see how they convey their experiences through words and ink. I read I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings by Maya Angelou last month and it's by far one of the best autobiographies I've come across so far.

This book is the first one from the series about her life and covers her life from childhood till the birth of her son. From the very first pages, I immediately became interested in Maya's story and the more I read, the more I felt like I knew her. It was like reading about a dear old friend.

Maya's life had not been easy. From a young age, her and her brother, Bailey, experienced the pain of abandonment when their parents sent them to live with their grandma in Stamps, a small Southern town. Their life in this small community, although not luxurious, it was comfortable and provided Maya with a sense of comfort and familiarity. From a very young age she developed a love for reading and writing, to which she would devote her life later on.

Everything changed once Maya and Bailey's mother decided to take them with her to St. Louis. Bailey was ecstatic to live with his mom but Maya was reluctant to abandon the place she called home. During this period, one of the worst events in her life occurred - she was raped by her mother's partner.

My heart panged for eight years old Maya. She was so confused and afraid. The portrayal of the aftermath and what happened after her rapist's conviction made me want to cry. She had to keep it secret because that monster had threatened to kill Bailey and Maya, who loved her brother so much, spoke no word. After that, she became a shell of her own self. She avoided talk and the only person with whom she felt comfortable talking to was her brother.

Throughout her life, Maya had experienced racism. A particular event that made my blood boil was when a white dentist, whom her grandmother had helped in the past, refused to treat her painful tooth ache because of their color. I literally saw red. But Maya did not succumb. Determined and strong spirited, she learnt to endure hate and not bow in front of white folks -whom she strongly disliked. I cheered for her when she managed to secure a job as a streetcar conductor -the first black woman in San Francisco to do so, mind you!

Speaking of racism, what surprised me is the portrayal of racism from black people towards Asians in the '40s, when Maya and Bailey moved to San Francisco to live again with their mother. WW2 had a great impact in the Asian community of the city and that lead to black people's rise in economy. Although they didn't abuse Asians in the same way whites treated black people, they still treated them in an inferior way, especially after gaining financial power. I know that this is an insignificant part in Maya's story but I found it interesting that she did not shy away from showing how abused people will seek to stand above weaker ones, once they gain the upper hand.

Family relationships was one of the most prominent themes in the book. Throughout my read, I found the parts about Maya's interaction with her family to be very emotional. She loved her grandma and uncle, even though they showed it in different ways. She struggled to reconnect with her mother, treating her as a stranger, only to warm up and even look up to her. Their relationship was oh, so complex and yet so beautiful. But the relationship I adored was the one with her brother. As someone who has a sibling, I related with Maya's love and devotion to Bailey. The siblings were close to each other and even when they argued, they still cared.

I loved Maya's prose. The writing was mostly simple but in some parts it became lyrical and beautiful. There was beauty even in sadness and sorrow. The descriptions of the places and people were very vivid and there were so many extracts that made me pause and think for a moment. 

Although the book has many sad moments, there is also so much hope and optimism. It reminds us that we need to work to make a better life for ourselves and that we shouldn't allow anyone and anything to take our will to live. The journey is not easy. But the outcome will be worth.

I really admired Angelou. I really did. A strong, independent woman, who loved her family and who sought a better life. Despite the hardships she had endured, she didn't back down and she managed to navigate in her life, no matter where she was or with whom. I am more than eager to read the rest of her biographies and it's certain to say that I have found a new role model.

books,Strategies for Libby when you want to read a long book,"I LOVE Libby -- I shall start by saying that. This is by no means meant to downplay how awesome it is. 

But managing the queue has felt a bit like a chore, and I wanted to know if y'all more experienced Libby uses have developed a strategy.

I mostly use Libby for audiobooks, and I like long books. However, my library only allows 7 days for poplar books. When you have a 28 hour audiobook-- well.... finishing it would become a chore, because at minimum, you'd have to listen to 4 hours a day. 

Here's my problem: I know the common strategies -- listen while you do dishes, listen on commutes, etc. etc. I already know that. But planning to listen that much every single day for four hours minimum makes reading feel like a job. I do not want my hobby to feel like a job. I want to listen when I can fully enjoy it. Making sure I map out reading times feels like optimizing the fun out of reading.

That inevitably means the rental will lapse, and with popular books, it may be another two months before I can get it again. 

If there is anyone out there with a similar struggle, what strategies do you take? Do you take notes so it's easier to pick back up in a few months? Do you just carry on listening and hope you remember relevant details? 

My personal solution hasn't been great - I've just purchased it from audible where I can listen at my own pace, but I really want to use the library more. ",268,175,2025-04-05 19:37:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1js8wz7/strategies_for_libby_when_you_want_to_read_a_long/

I have yet to see the play/film. I quite enjoyed this read. Captivating, quick, and drove home the central theme of not judging a book by its cover (AKA recognition of personal bias, particularly in the context of extreme decisions) throughout.

books,Let's talk about Rebecca by Daphne du Maurier,"Firstly, what are your thoughts on the titular character? Some people glorify her as a feminist icon (lived life on her own terms, was sexually free, etc) but I can't perceive her like that. She whipped a horse until it bled. I also might be reading too deeply into Maxim saying that she told him things on the cliff in Monte Carlo that he can never repeat again (and I don't think he was talking about her adultery, because he repeatedly acknowledges that). I don't take a lot of the things Maxim said about Rebecca for granted, but I do believe she was a terrible person. I also have a problem in general with people trying to put characters in contemporary boxes (""Rebecca was a girlboss""), I feel like it dilutes/strips them of any and all nuance.

Imo Maxim was the victim in his first marriage because Rebecca recognized and manipulated his attachment to/love for Manderley and went back on their agreement. I don't condone his murdering her but he was pushed to it because she manipulated him and orchestrated it so that she'd continue to haunt him even after she was gone. She was evil and manipulative for sure, everyone who didn't love her, hated her, there was no in between. 

What do you think of the relationship between Mrs de Winter #2 and Maxim? Do you think it's predatory? I don't think it is, although there was definitely a power imbalance and he was a neglectful husband. I don't think he loved her in the beginning (or even for much of the middle), but he was genuinely fond of her because she was the complete opposite of Rebecca (and yeah, some of those qualities were because she was young and very naive.) I think he starts to respect her/lean on her more after his confession, and after Manderley burns down they find companionship and peace with each other, but they are far from the perfect match. I lowkey think she'd be better with Frank, he was much more attentive and thoughtful and they were compatible but she pedestalises Maxim too much for that to ever happen lol

Manderley burning down was good for both of them (especially Maxim) and is the reason they end up as a somewhat happy couple. Both of them have a toxic(?) relationship with the house and neither of them could have moved on from Rebecca's shadow if they continued living there.",111,38,2025-04-05 15:32:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1js3jaj/lets_talk_about_rebecca_by_daphne_du_maurier/

books,Welcome to Night Vale.,"Possibly the strangest book you will ever read. And possibly my most favorite book of 2025.  
I can not imagine how anything will top this experience this year.

I am in heaven. 

Horror and Absurdist Humour are my two favortie genres and this book has been a treat, reminded me to re-listen to the episodes.   
I used to listen to horror audio shows but then I stopped and night vale along with the magnus archives were my most favorite, so imagine my surprise when I came across the book!  
I was in love, from page one. Like a stranger and an old friend at the same time.  
So absurd, creepy, and yet profound.  
I am an absurdist at heart and I am in heaven rn. had the best week reading welcome to night vale.

Went to add it to my goodreads shelf and discovered there are two more.  
heaven.  
It's healing me with how real it gets all of sudden.  
The writing is amazing.  
The kind of book where you really can not predict the next sentence and out of nowhere comes a profound quote:  
""Look, life is stressful. This is true everywhere. But life in Night Vale is more stressful. There are things lurking in the shadows. Not the projections of a worried mind, but literal Things, lurking, literally, in shadows. Conspiracies are hidden in every storefront, under every street, and floating in helicopters above. And with all that there is still the bland tragedy of life. Births, deaths, comings, goings, the gulf of subjectivity and bravado between us and everyone we care about. All is sorrow, as a man once said without really doing much about it.""  
""You say your life is unraveling. Your life cannot unravel. Your life is your life. You haven’t lost it. It’s just different now.""

and the critique of modern society: ""A warning to our listeners: There have been reports of counterfeit police officers on the roads, who, instead of looking after our interests, work under arbitrary authority to unfairly target and extort those who are least able, societally, to fight back. If you see one of these FalsePolice, act right away by shrugging and thinking What am I gonna do? and then seeing if anything funny is on Twitter.""

Last year I discovered and then read all 41 Discworld books and since then my taste has changed for the better and I have become even more selective in what I enjoy reading, and this book has blown me away.  
It's strange in the best way.

books,"I love introducing my kids to books by listening to audiobooks together before they go to bed. But hoo boy, despite loving the books for what they are, the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series (so far) has, in my opinion, bar-none the worst audiobook narration I've ever heard. How and why?","Before I start I want to make clear that I think the *Percy Jackson and the Olympians* books are really great YA/children's novels. I love them as stories and books, especially for kids, and these books deserve better audiobook narration.

That aside... I've listened to ~200 audiobooks in my life. Without a doubt, the Percy Jackson books have (in my opinion) the worst directed/edited narration of any of those audiobooks. 

Many, many lines are read incorrectly... 

* characters are given accents that don't match the text. 

* serious characters are given super-goofy inappropriate voices, like

  * >!Luke being one of the main villains but having a surfer dude voice!<, 

  * Ghosts haunting Percy sound like the old Disney giant from Jack and the Beanstalk who can't say ""pistachio""... 

  * Blackjack is unlistenable, and I'll bet money Jesse Bernstein's vocal cords still haven't recovered from the injuries sustained while voicing Blackjack. 

  * Tyson sounds mentally disabled.

  * And more. 

* 10 or 20 sentences per chapter spoken with incorrect emotion, incorrect tone of voice (to the point you have to stop and think what the text actually was trying to say), and/or spoken with emphasis on the incorrect words... and flat-out mispronuciations. 

It's extremely distracting. It's *bad*-bad for a professional production of one of the most popular children's novel series in recent history.

The narration sounds like what I might sound like if someone just randomly turned on a recorder while I was reading Percy Jackson to my kids.

I'm not a perfect reader either. Like the actual narrator, I would read some sentences incorrectly just like he does... the difference is that if I were recording a major audiobook release, I would expect my director or editor to listen to what I said so I could re-record those lines that sounded off.

The only two possible conclusions in my mind are either that the audiobook director and editor were completely incompetent, or that the narrator was so bad that they had to give up and make do with the best of a bunch of bad takes... Like maybe they knew after 20 bad readings that it wasn't going to get any better? Who knows.

I know this is super harsh but it's also genuinely how I feel in the middle of Book 4, I literally can't believe how bad the narration is on this. Again, I've listened to probably about 200 audiobooks.

I think it's on the editor and director (Did they have one? They say there was but I don't see much evidence). There was no pride on the production side... this would have been much better if there was better direction and better editing. 

But there wasn't.

These are great books for kids and deserve better narration.",322,97,2025-04-04 21:46:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1jrktc0/i_love_introducing_my_kids_to_books_by_listening/
books,Noticing Broad Similarities in Books of the Same Language,"So, I read a lot, like most folks in this subreddit, and I have really tried to read more from authors around the world. I’m no linguist, so I’m forced to read the English translations of these works, but I’ve found some interesting patterns in world literature that I thought I might share. I find that various languages really lend themselves to different types of writing mediums and styles. Obviously these are very broad generalizations, just my experience. 

-English is an incredibly vocabulary heavy language, borrowing from virtually every other language at this point. Their champion is the novel, to no one’s surprise with writers like Dickens or Austen. English literature tends to be wordy but not verbose, it just usually requires that many words to adequately describe what you’re referring to. English novels tend to be morally driven, as opposed to character or plot driven. 

 -More than english, I think the Novel is really best expressed through Indian and Russian literature. Tamil is believed to have the largest vocabulary of any language, but more than that both Russia and India have incredibly rich folklore backgrounds. Both cultures prize plot over other elements of the book, and both culture’s works frequently have casts in the hundreds. For me, and Indian novel is always full of high drama and tragedy, without falling into being goofy. Russian literature, especially Tolstoy, is often same, with others like Dostoevsky or Turgenev being more inward facing. The one real split between these two is that the Russians tend to write philosophically more than the Indians. 

-French literature is (as is almost stereotypically French) emotional. Hugo, Proust, Dumas, etc. all cut to your heart and beg you for a passionate experience. Plot comes secondarily but organically to the relationships between characters. French literature speaks to your heart. 

-Korean literature is, to me, akin to the historic differences between film and television. While the latter evolved from radio and storytelling, the former was derived from photography and was about striking visuals. Korean literature will never say 10 words when 1 would suffice. Korean books tend to be very short but evocative, creating an ambiance that you live in rather than a plot that you pursue. It’s very peaceful and often very melancholic. 

-Japanese literature is both similar to Korean and completely different. The Japanese focus more on plot and often have significantly larger novels, but compared with western literature it’s still not what I’d consider plot driven. Instead, Japanese literature meanders, taking the reader where it chooses in a zig zag, loop de loop path that can often be hard to follow. There is no 3 act structure, but that’s not to say that Japanese literature is lost, only that you may feel lost while in it. It still resolves and you see that every detail was almost always planned from the start. 

-Irish literature tends to be short and playful. Rules get thrown out of the window. Joyce is of course the poster child for Irish writing, but Beckett or Toibin also play with form and give you shocking experiences without you having realized. With Irish writing I wouldn’t say plot or characters are the primary goals, but rather the story is. Irish writing always feels as though someone is sitting in front of you telling you a story, one you can’t always follow, but one they insist upon. I love it. 

Again, these are broad strokes and only a few cultures are discussed. I’m curious what others think though and what other similar patterns can be found in other cultures’ works.

I somewhat enjoyed it, it was intriguing and frustrating at times, also fascinating with some parts, but looking back upon the flashbacks I realize ""oh, there is a point to them.""

I'm not really sure what to rate it as. It's not terrible, it's not the greatest, but it's not mediocre either. But it wasn't as though I keeping an eye out for plot holes or inconsistencies. I just read it and wanted to see where the story went. (Perhaps my fault for not thinking critically, I only realize flaws until I see other people point them out.)

What I don't get, however, is the genres the book is labeled as online. Fantasy and Sci-Fi. Well, fantasy I get.

I read the book, quickly realizing it was set in a fantasy world, but a fantasy world without magic or fairies. But it 100% was not our world.

But I read the entire book, and not once did it feel like a sci-fi book. Unless you count melting gold as sci-fi, or this being a world that isn't ours. Either I somehow missed the sci-fi or it just doesn't exist.

Is it actually sci-fi or just the internet mislabeling it?",12,7,2025-04-05 01:02:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1jrpaqe/the_company_by_k_j_parker/
books,After Ready Player One and Armada I'm so glad I picked up Dungeon Crawler Carl.,"I really enjoyed *Ready Player One*—the nostalgia was great, and it was a dumb, fun ride. But as much as I liked the references, the book made me cringe more times than I care to count, and everything outside of the nostalgia was either bad or forgettable. Still, I decided to give Ernest Cline another shot and read *Armada*, another video game-centric novel—this time with absolutely no redeeming qualities.

Cline has an obsession with making his protagonists know-it-alls who are effortlessly amazing at video games, and while that was off-putting in *RPO*, I didn’t realize how bad it was until I started reading *Dungeon Crawler Carl* by Matt Dinniman. This is my first book by Dinniman, and I’m only a few chapters in, but wow—what a refreshing change. The protagonist isn’t some flawless genius, the game mechanics are well explained, and the humor actually lands. You can tell that Dinniman is genuinely funny and well-versed in modern culture, with references that feel natural rather than forced.

*Dungeon Crawler Carl* feels like everything Ernest Cline *wanted* to write but completely missed the mark on—though if making millions and getting a decent movie adaptation counts as failing, I guess we should all be so lucky.",407,188,2025-04-04 00:45:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1jqwmwm/after_ready_player_one_and_armada_im_so_glad_i/

With everything happening in the world right now, and the direction humanity seems to be going toward, this book obliterated whatever bit of hope I had left in our collective goodness.  

For those unfamiliar, it’s a non-fiction book of a 14-year-old Korean girl kidnapped by the Japanese Imperial Army during their occupation of Asia. The story follows her forced journey across East Asia as a ""comfort woman""—a euphemism that barely scratches the surface of the systemic dehumanization, abuse, and violence she endured. The worst part? Knowing this isn’t fiction. These were real lives, real atrocities, and real systems.

books,"I underestimated Red, White & Royal Blue","When I started reading this novel by recommendation of a friend, I expected a simple novel centered around a power fantasy. I'm glad to report that I was so very wrong. This is a sweet and very catchy story, with the struggles of the LGBT community and the centuries of oppression maskerading as ""tradition"" interwoven with the plot in a spectacularly intelligent way. I liked Heartstopper, but it felt too preachy at times. This, instead, taught me about queer history in a very subtle way, making people from centuries ago feel like living links in a very long, wonderful chain.

This might be my favourite queer romance yet, and inspired me to up my game with the gay romance novel I just finished writing and I have now to edit. I'm glad I read this and sad that I didn't read it sooner.",172,27,2025-04-03 23:29:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1jquufe/i_underestimated_red_white_royal_blue/
books,What book you read that was saved by the ending or one specific moment?,"I often read many people who say that a book was ruined because of  the ending and how some novels lose strength when they reach the finale, but I'd like to know the other way around. Has there been any book that has been boring, or not just satisfying but the ending (or even some fragment, dialogue, even a phrase) has made it worthy of reading for you?

In my case, I can say that the Road by Mc Carthy was not as endearing  as I thought it would be; I honestly did not like it, found it too dry and felt that the topic was something I had seen several times before. But the ending when the father says to the kid that once he dies he can still talk to him, was really precious and I was like ''this is what I was waiting for so long!'' (it wasn't that long given the book is actually short). 

The Wasp Factory by Iain Banks was another let down. I appreciate Banks and his freedom in which he can  dwell between normal topics and tackle sci fi whenever he wants to, I admire that of him, but I can't seem to truly enjoy his works (something that saddens me, because I'd love to). However, the plot twist of Wasp Factory was really intriguing and had me reading deeply for like 10 pages and wishing the entire book had been like that.

I have other examples, but I'd like to read yours.

Do you happen to have experiences like those? Where you hate a book but you rescue something really valuable out of it?

books,"The Bridgetower Sonata, by Emmanuel Dongala (2017)","Dongala is a Congolese chemist and author, and I've been enjoying immensely my self-directed tour of African authors lately, and while this guy wasn't next on my list, he's the next as far as people worth mentioning go.  Meaning I tried a couple of others first and didn't feel like saying much about them.

Dongala is not a great writer.  His characters are flat or nonexistent, and to me, character is the number one thing.  If you can make your characters believable, memorable, and unique, you've done something.

And so what's interesting about this book is, I'm not putting it down 85 pages in, saying to myself, what the heck... I could be reading Zane Grey right now.  No.  The story is an interesting one all by itself, without any characters.  (I don't mean it has no ""characters,"" I mean the author moves them from place to place in pretty predictable ways, such that I never wonder what's going to happen next.  It doesn't interest me.)

First of all, it's based on a true story.  There really was a violinist, last name Bridgetower, for whom Beethoven originally named his famous Kreutzer Sonata.  The two were great friends, until evidently Bridgetower pointed out, no doubt in a sober and thoughtful manner, that one of Beethoven's girlfriends was a bit too much of a woman of the people, or something, and Ludwig von struck his ex-friend's name off his sonata in a classical fit of pique.  (Pun intentional, sorry but not very.)

And Bridgetower was, in modern terms, black.  Son of a West Indian but born in Poland, raised in (relative) wealth and privilege and, oddly, a hell of a good violinist.  Well, who wasn't black, right?  Pushkin, Dumas pere, Dumas fils, the list is endless.  Well, Pushkin is a bit of a stretch, but still.  The connection is there.  And in the book, we've already met another -- the Chevalier de Saint-George, born in Guadeloupe, recognized for his swordsmanship and then, later, as a composer and a rather well known conductor.

And the story -- to get back to why I'm still reading it in spite of the author's failings -- took place at a very interesting time.  Bridgetower grew up during and around the French Revolution.  About which legends still multiply, almost 250 years later.

Oh, I don't know.  I'm just making excuses for myself to keep reading.  You never know what's going to happen next, right?  Eventually Beethoven must make an entrance, and who knows?

books,What makes a book a good retelling (mild spoilers for A Whole New World by Liz Braswell)?,"I have read two retellings recently. 

The name drop by Susan Lee and A Whole New World by Liz Braswell

The name drop is a retelling of the prince and the pauper story and given that story has been told a million times I think there's a lot of leeway. The book can have the premise and basic switch of the two MCs and be considered a retelling while being almost completely beat by beat different than the source material. 

A whole new world is very specifically a retelling of the Disney movie Aladdin. Not a retelling of the Arabian nights tale or one thousand and one nights (which is what Disney's Aladdin is). 

I listened to the audiobook of A Whole New World. The first two hours are a beat by beat retelling of the first act of the movie. Which you go through a lot faster by watching the movie. Plus you don't get the great songs in the book. The book is middle grade and has a bit of an edgy PG 13 vibe. I can't imagine any teenager interested in the book hasn't seen the Disney movie at least once. 

I picked it up because of a storygraph book club read and one person DNFd it because it was beat by beat the same as the movie for so long. 

I am struggling to decide if this is good or bad or neutral storytelling.

It could have been different from the start but given it's a specific Disney retelling would it be disrespectful to the source material to have a different plot from the start? Would it be better for the twist to come sooner?+

If you've seen the movie you can skip the first 2 hours of the book and lose out on nothing. Is there some benefit to having essentially the script of the first act of the movie in the beginning of the book? 

I haven't read a lot of retellings and I'm curious on other people's thoughts on this. 

+I'm giving the book some grace here because once we get to the twist Jasmine doesn't feel like the same character from the beginning of the book. It maybe would have been a better story had Jasmine had more tweaks to be consistent or show a clearer character growth through the film.",8,10,2025-04-04 07:58:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1jr4w2j/what_makes_a_book_a_good_retelling_mild_spoilers/
books,China Miéville says we shouldn’t blame science fiction for its bad readers,"I was looking for the status of Miéville's next book (soon!) and came across this article.

https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/30/author-china-mieville-says-we-shouldnt-blame-science-fiction-for-its-bad-readers/

An interesting take on us sci-fi fans, how sci-fi shapes our dreams and desires, and how idealism crosses over into reality.

It's a long read for Reddit standards, but the TLDR quote would be:

""...even though some science-fiction writers do think in terms of their writing being either a utopian blueprint or a dystopian warning, I don’t think that’s what science fiction ever is. It’s always about now. It’s always a reflection. It’s a kind of fever dream, and it’s always about its own sociological context.""

books,The Nickel Boys is one of the most powerful books I've read so far,"
During the Oscars buzz, I saw many people talking about the movie ""The Nickel Boys"", the adaptation of Colson Whitehead's novel. I found the book in my university's library in February. I want to expand my horizons by reading more books written by POC and since I wanted to watch the movie as well, I decided to pick up the book. 

If only I knew what I signed up for. 

From the very beginning, I felt a pull towards Elwood and his life. He quickly became a character I became attached to. I felt for him and the conditions he had to live in. I remember myself smiling at his admiration towards Martin Luther King and his determination to fight for his people's rights, like his teacher and peers did. And above all that, he remained a kind and compassionate person. He cared for his grandma and friends and he had a strong sense of justice. Although he quickly learned that being ethic wouldn't always get him where he wanted, he didn't lose his humanity even when he was at his lowlest. 

Elwood desperately tried to cling to the hope of his release. He wanted to believe that his grandma would manage to free him and that justice would prevail. But alas, that only remained an idea. Justice never came. Elwood realized that no one cared for the future of a black boy. The longer he stayed at the Nickel School, the more his eyes opened to the cruel world around him and the painful truth: black people were treated as something disposable and they were inferior to white people. And that truth crashed him. All of his dreams about a better world were in vain. Martin Luther King's speeches were for nothing. The future of black people could never change and they would always be ridiculed by the whites. 

I felt despair while I was reading about Elwood's change. I wanted him to not lose hope and continue his fight for a better world. But how could he after everything he had endure? How could he find the strength (mentally and physically) to strive for freedom and justice in a world ruled by ""the white House""? Thus, Elwood became a shell of his old, optimistic self. And yet, not everything was lost, for there was someone who tried to cheer Elwood up and support him: his friend Turner. 

Elwood's friendship with Turner was one of the best aspects in the story and one of the few positive ones. Despite the circumstances, the two boys became close friends. Their shared pain and abuse during their serving time made them bond quite quickly. Turner, who had been in the Nickel Academy longer than Elwood, always tried to find some way to help Elwood and make him adjust to the new environment while navigating in the horrors of the Academy. 

It was very interesting to observe the personalities of these two boys. While Elwood appeared to be more naive and optimistic at first, Turner was more pragmatic and down-to-earth. Since he had experienced first-hand the cruelty of the Nickel School and the racism from white people, he didn't believe that there was a chance of justice and freedom for black people. On the other hand, Elwood tried to maintain his optimistic ideas, believing that he would be free soon to pursue his studies and go back to his family, only for him to realise how wrong he had been. The boys came to accept the injustice and abuse and together they endured it, in an attempt to take comfort in their friendship and similar experiences in the Academy. They found refuge in each other and their bond helped them endure the constant abuse and mistreatment. 

The writing was simple and straightforward. Whitehead did not go that far into details about what happened in the Academy, leaving the reader to imagine the atrocities that took place there. His tone was pretty much journalisting and honestly, I think it worked. I didn't need to read pages upon pages of sexual assault, beating, mockery or constant discrimination. Even the few passages that tackled Nickel's racism were very disturbing. I could hardly read them, let alone imagine the rest of the abuse. Additionally, there were many beautiful and powerful quotes regarding racism and black people's right for equality which really resonated with me. 

Don't get me on the ending! Omg, that ending! I really didn't see that coming. When it was revealed that Elwood had been dead and that Turner had taken Elwood's identity after his death, I was shocked. I frantically read the lines over and over again but when it became clear that Elwood had been killed, I burst into tears and wept for almost one hour. I cried and cried not only because of sadness but anger as well. I kept thinking that it was not fair, that Elwood deserved to live a full life and that he deserved to be happy. But Whitehead painfully reminded me of the injustice that prevailed (and still does). How many other boys have been robbed of their lives? How many people have cut the thread of black people's lives simply because they had committed the crime of being born a different race? And how could society turn a blind eye? These are some of the questions that were brought up in my mind. 

I'll be honest, the Nickel Boys was a pretty much frustrating read. Not because it was bad but because it made me want to smash the head of every single person who mistreated the boys. But the thing that made my heart drop is the realisation that while I was reading, I could recall similar events in today's world. Even now, in the year of 2025, racism is still pretty common and while the circumstances have improved, prejudice and hatred continue to occupy people's hearts. I feel sick seeing people treat POC like they are below them. I am from Greece and let me tell you that it's gotten really annoying to see people making fun of POC, calling them names or insulting their intelligence, skills etc. What more must it take to put a stop to that? 

But besides that, the book made me feel more positive emotions too. The interactions between Elwood and Turner put a smile on my face and their relationship felt like a breath of fresh air. And I always liked reading about the white people being put on their places. I was ecstatic when Griff won against the best white student boxer(let's ignore the aftermath) and the few scenes of the black students interacting and acting like a team put a smile on my face. But above all, I felt hope. Yes, even among the bleak setting, there was a ray of hope about a better world, one where people would push for what is right. 

If I had to point out an aspect of the book that could have been better, I would say that I would have enjoyed a little bit more of emotional depth. While the simple and journalistic format serves its purpose, there were times when I was kinda apathetic at first, like I was reading a history book. And that's not bad per se, it's just that it made me feel disconnected from the characters at times. I felt like I was reading an academic book instead of a novel and I almost felt guilty for not experiencing more emotions resonance. 

Despite that, _The Nickel Boys_ remains one of the most powerful books I've read. It will live in me for a very long time and I cannot help recommending it enough. I know that we cannot change the world rapidly. But we can still make it a better place for all people if we inform and educate ourselves about discrimination and racism. 

Let's keep fighting for a world where Elwood could live happily.

Maybe its because the trauma depiction is good? People like a good cry? I cried a bit but not enough for this to be worth it at all, although my life has been pretty trauma free so maybe this wasn't for me, I just found the level of the endless abuse disgusting by her. There really didn't need to be that much to get the point across. Did not need to be 800 pages at all either.

The fact that the 3 other characters really don't matter that much (or at least 2 are essentially worthless) doesn't bother me, or that they all become omega experts in their fields is fine, but how much Jude gets the shit kicked out of him incessantly is far too excessive for me.

books,I'm Simply Floored By Stephen Markley's THE DELUGE [2023],"I truly can't believe it, but I came across this book by accident. I'm sure I would've discovered it eventually  because I'm a huge fan of environmental or ecological themes/subjects in novels \[stuff like A Friend of the Earth by T.C. Boyle or Monkey Wrench Gang\]. But I hadn't heard of The Deluge or Stephen Markley. I just like long books! and I happened to pass by it in a book store aisle on the way out of town. The cover caught my attention and it sounded interesting and I needed a book for the trip, so I picked it up.

Now it's quite possibly my favorite novel! The subject is pretty simple: what might the world and especially America look like and go through due to climate change in the next 25 years or so. But it's told from a slew of different characters' perspectives \[I usually am not a fan of more than 3ish narrators, but T.D. pulled it off\] from a wide range of socioeconomic backgrounds--a scientist, a wealthy socialite, a young climate activist, etc. It's so spectacularly rendered. The writing is incredible. The characters are even better. And the plot/themes may be best of all.

I've read the 800+ page book in paperback and listened to a third or so of the audiobook--some of the narrators are really good, a couple of them not so much. My wife absolutely *could not stand* the chapters voiced and ""written"" by the Asperger's character \[Asher\], it just grated on her too much.

Do you think it presented a realistic portrayal of things to come? Did you have a favorite chapter/section narrator? I really liked Shane's, and Mathew Stanton \[Kate's boyfriend\]. I've *definitely* met woman who have the same kind of intensity and passion and devil-may-care insouciance. WHAT a character! I'm also very curious to hear people's thoughts on the different narrators, and which of them represented, in your mind, the most effective or accurate perspective on things as their world got worse and worse?

I just adore this book so much and want to share the joy and get some other perspectives on it--I certainly come at it from a very particular angle, so it's POSSIBLE I'm more likely than most to fall in love with it...",40,20,2025-04-03 05:48:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1jq8jvx/im_simply_floored_by_stephen_markleys_the_deluge/
books,Middlemarch is the best book I have ever read (spoilers in the text!),"At the start of 2025, I decided this would be my year of reading classics (inspired, of all people, by Matt Yglesias!). I wanted to ease myself in, so I began with a couple of Agatha Christie novels, followed by Pride and Prejudice as a warm-up. Then I decided to read Middlemarch as an act of radical self improvement - although all I really knew about it was that it was by George Eliot, whom I (fairly, I think!) assumed was a man!

I found it a real slog at first, but something happened at the end of book 1 and I was hooked. There's not really a plot as such; just the lives of people in a provincial town, but what reels you in is the characters. Eliot describes their inner lives, their motivations so clearly and so directly you feel as though you're standing in the room with them, inside their heads, feeling their thoughts. At many points I felt as though I was watching a film with narration - the book was incredibly cinematic for something written in the 19th century. 

On the non-literary side of the spectrum I'm a sucker for a Ken Follett novel, and in many respects George Eliot reminded me of one of his books (or vice versa!). There are no easy romances but people making mistakes and living with mistakes, people getting second chances at love and taking them despite the sacrifices that involves. No one in the book is perfect (except maybe Caleb Garth) but everyone's motivations are so clearly described that you often feel some sympathy for them - even the wrong'uns. 

As ever when I read a fantastic book I'm desperate to discuss it - anyone else read it recently and have any thoughts?",133,66,2025-04-02 21:38:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1jpxon0/middlemarch_is_the_best_book_i_have_ever_read/
books,Annihilation By Jeff Vandermeer,"This story begins by leaving so many different important factors out. I know that this is intentional, but I find because it is so imaginative/far-fetched it becomes hard to really become emotionally invested in the book and follow the constructed narrative.

1. Is the real world like our world? Why did we leave Area X? Why is there a border? Why does the Southern Reach make the border a complete mystery?
2. Character development - Seemingly (on purpose), this book lacks the ability to connect you with any of the characters, and this is obviously intentional because we see that none of the characters are given names.
3. Area X - The Introduction to the novel creates this idea that the story is going to create this elaborate and complex world in your head. Which I do think ""atmospheric creation"" is this books bread and butter - but thats about the only thing it does exceptionally well.
4. The ending - The book lacked much emotional connection to the Biologist and her husband - with only a few excerpts and passages within the book that actually hinted to their relationship. What Vandermeer failed to do as well - was create emotional depth within the Biologist and her husband. Not that I didn't enjoy reading about her and her husband (they were actually the only parts of the book that were grounded in reality) - but to make the entire ending about them, when the book failed to show depth in their connection/story, I felt it was a bit lackluster.
5. Area X (locations) - The three main locations in the book are the Lighthouse, the Tower, and Base Camp. These three things didn't really have much connection, and the book failed to grasp me on why they were connected and what they really meant. What I think I mean by this is that the mystery of Area X was a bit *too vague*, as in one moment she is fighting off a boar in the reeds - to her climbing up a lighthouse on the beach. I think if there was more backstory of Area X and what it was, it would be easier to find the emotional connection to the story. It became to the point where you do feel you want the mystery to be solved, but it is also in tangential that we don't even have a clue *what the mystery even is.*
6. So what even happened? Too many possibilities - Besides the fact we never find out what Area X is, Why they are there, or anything in the ""before"" the expedition sense, the narrator is difficult to follow, and there isn't really ever any actual resolution. She is exposed to the fungal spores early on, and we never really find out if the things she is seeing are real, or different from everyone else. We never really get a grasp on what the psychologist knew, why she was using hypnosis, or what her last conversation with the biologist on the beach really meant. Long story short, they all die off, without much explaining, and no depth. If the ending had tried to make sense of it all - given any type of purpose, I felt it could have worked and flowed much better.

The locations are disjointed, and don't really seem to make sense together. It was hard for me to imagine why a lighthouse, a underground tunnel, and a beach with moaning monsters and reeds had to do with each other - and how they flowed together. The Introduction makes it seem Area X is entirely different from our word *in its entirety,* but for me it seems that the only location that differentiated from how our world looks, is really the tower. or the tunnel. or whatever it is. The only other thing that she points to being different is the animals, and how their cells become (or always were) human.

I still did enjoy this book and felt it did one thing really well: setting an atmosphere.

I felt as though I could relate a lot to the biologists solitude, and interest in the ecosystem/animals around her. The Tower and Crawler were given a beautiful way about them, and in the sense of the *nothing about this book makes any sense,* I did really enjoy the description of the Crawler, her drowning, and her inability to get to the door.

I think the atmosphere of the animals, and the Biologists ability to slowly realize she will never get home, never reconcile with her husband, and never truly understand the world she was in nor the one she is in now, was done very well. It will help readers reflect on their own lives, and maybe make an effort to connect with those close to them, while they still have a chance.

I feel the reference to not ever really being able to understand meaning/direction in Area X is very translatable to our world, as we will never truly understand and find meaning while living here on Earth.",5,54,2025-04-03 20:03:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1jqph0e/annihilation_by_jeff_vandermeer/

books,Paladin's Grace - The author's treatment of Stephen's PTSD,"I finished Paladin's Grace recently.  I enjoyed most of the story, the characters, and the tone.  But the specific way the author frames Stephen's PTSD in-universe really put me off.  

I do agree with reviews that there is a bit too much ""he/she can't possibly be in love with ME"" happening every other chapter, and at points the plot is mostly forgotten.  But I did enjoy both Grace and Stephen as characters.  Grace for her quirkiness and three-dimensional interest in her work; she's written like a person who is a woman, where too many authors write female leads as something ancillary to other characters.  Stephen for his care, his awareness, and his realistic perspective on trying to do right while acknowledging that it's impossible to be perfect.  

Stephen's PTSD is handled well in most respects, as something that weighs on him and shapes his decisions and his feelings throughout the story, and isn't watered down.  As a former berserker paladin, he lives in constant caution of awaking his ""battle tide"" and hurting those around him.  I believe it's part of why he's such a careful and conscientious person when dealing with those around him.  

I generally appreciate the portrayal, but one specific instance hit me with complete disbelief, and I haven't seen it talked about online.  During one particularly close and intimate outing, Stephen is carried away by the mutual moment and kisses Grace.  The author goes to some length to maintain Stephen as a considerate person, as he gives Grace plenty of room to either reciprocate or rebuff him, which is all well and good.  

During the kiss, Stephen feels his passions rising, and a deep feeling within him is too reminiscent of his battle tide, which triggers his PTSD and freaks him out, as he's terrified of hurting her.  He breaks the kiss and communicates his desire to stop.  Admittedly, he doesn't communicate himself very well, but Grace reacts negatively and resentfully, freezing him out and shutting down the conversation. This is later treated throughout the book as a personal failing for Stephen and an act of harm committed against Grace.  The author really hammers it home, to the point that I had to keep coming back to the relevant section to figure out what on earth Stephen supposedly did that harmed Grace.  Here's the text: 

>Her lips were like ice against his, and for a moment all he could think of was that she was cold, of course she was cold, it was a cool day and they’d been standing around in cold mud and he had not realized. He wanted to wrap his body around hers and breathe warmth into her.

>He pulled one of his gloves off and lifted his hand to her cheek. It was cold under his palm, but the heat that sprang up between them threatened to burn him where he stood.

>He’d pictured this since yesterday. He would go slowly, carefully, as delicate as a moth’s wings. Sudden passion would only scare her.

>It would sure as hell scare him.

>Gently. Carefully. Let her pull away, if this isn’t what she wants.

>Grace’s mouth opened under his and all his good intentions went straight to hell.

>She tasted of salt and sage and her mouth was as hot as her lips were cold. He pulled her tight against him and her hands slid up his back, pressing her body even closer. The space between them seemed intolerably large, even if it was only a few layers of clothing and—well, admittedly a chain hauberk, that wasn’t nothing, even if he was vaguely astonished that it didn’t turn to ash and fall away the longer they kissed.

>He tangled his bare hand in her hair, feeling the strands curling around his fingers. His lips left hers and he trailed kisses over her jaw, down her throat, feeling the cold skin warm under his touch. She made a small, pleased sound in the back of her throat, almost a whimper, and he thought he might lose control right then and there.

>Control.

>What little he had was already slipping, burned away by the heat between them, by the sounds she made as he set his lips against her pulse and felt it beating fast, by the sensation of her body rubbing against his.

>Dangerous, whispered his mind. This is dangerous.

>The tide rising in his blood was red, not black, but it was too much alike, too close. He could lose himself too easily in the heat of her body. This was a tide that could wash away his past and his duty and everything else that held him back and kept him sane. If kissing her was doing this much to him, how much farther would it go?

>He didn’t know. He wanted very much to find out, to let passion burn away the hollow, lonely places for a moment, to be with her and for a few minutes to not be broken.

>She was melting against him, her hand curling against the back of his neck to draw him closer. More, he thought, mental voice hazy with lust. More. He could give her more. He could give her everything, could stoke the fire between them until it consumed them both.

>She gasped, and even though it was from pleasure—he was nearly certain it was pleasure—the sound, and the thought for an instant that he might be hurting her, shocked him free of the tide.

>Stephen lifted his head and stepped back.

>“I’m sorry,” he said, releasing her. “That shouldn’t have happened.”

>Her eyes had been heavy-lidded, her mouth lifted in a smile. He watched realization slash across her face as if he’d slapped her. He felt like the lowest worm in creation.

>Shit. You didn’t want to hurt her and this is what you get. Saint’s bloody tongue. Her face relaxed into chilly immobility, but the hurt in her eyes felt like a knife in his ribs. He honestly would have rather she stabbed him.

>“Grace, I’m sorry, that wasn’t what I meant to—”

>“I see.”

>“Dammit, Grace, I didn’t mean…” He reached out for her, then stopped. She skittered away from his touch as if he were diseased.

>She held up a hand. “It’s fine. You’re not interested. I am not interested either. No one is interested.”

>“It’s not that I’m not interested, it’s…” What could he say? I would take you right here, right now, if I could, but I’m afraid I might run mad and kill us both? This wasn’t the sort of thing that put a woman you’d kissed at ease.

>“Then what is—no. No, you know, don’t tell me.” She turned away and began stalking down the hillside. “I am not interested. That’s all that matters.”

>She was not a terribly good liar. Her swollen lips and mussed hair didn’t help.

>“It’s just…I’m a paladin,” he said, chasing after her. “One of the Saint of Steel’s.”

>“Is your order sworn to celibacy, then?” Each word sounded as if it had been carved out of ice.

>“No, of course not, but…” He raked his hands through his hair. “I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have done that. I shouldn’t have done any of this. I know, the last few days, I…I might have let you think there could be something between us, but…”

>“I wasn’t the one who insisted you come here,” said Grace.

>Which was true and shut him up. Probably that’s a good thing. If Istvhan were here, he’d put me in a headlock and tell me to not say another word.

>“Anyway, you’ve got a lot of nerve,” she said, squelching and sliding down the hill. He wanted to offer her his arm again, and didn’t dare. “I don’t recall suggesting there be anything between us. You may have rescued me a time or two, but that doesn’t mean I’m going to fall at your feet. My life is very good and I love it and I don’t wish to see it disrupted.”

>

Events sweep them apart again, and they end up brewing over the moment in much the same way.  Grace is unremorseful and unreflective of her own actions, and blames Stephen entirely.  She confers with her close friend Marguerite, who agrees that Stephen has screwed up and needs to make it right.  

For his part, Stephen also blames himself entirely and places Grace on a pedestal.  He seeks absolution (yes, really) and confers with his own friends, who pretty much tell him to make himself happy and give Grace what she wants.  

The author absolutely beats the reader over the head with this theme: 

>Stephen woke up stiff and sore and his first thought was that he was a miserable bastard of a man who’d hurt a woman who deserved a whole lot better.

To the point where it honestly begins to read like satire:

>Stephen set the sock aside. He was going to have to face up to the fact that he’d made a mess of things and go and apologize. Which was itself fraught because he knew his apology might not help and that meant that he was apologizing for himself, not for her. It wasn’t her job to absolve him of the fact that he’d been an ass. If all he wanted was absolution, he should probably be asking Istvhan to take his confession again.

>But dammit, she had to know that she hadn’t been wrong. He’d led her down a road he had no right to go down, and it was entirely his fault and none of hers. That she was attractive and he was just too damn broken, that was all.

I get that sometimes characters have perspectives that don't align with reality, but the perspective is shared by both protagonists, reinforced by inner dialogue and conversations with others, and is never addressed through the rest of the book.  When Grace finds herself in peril and Stephen comes to her rescue, even the rescue is painted as something Stephen owes Grace for his transgression.  

>Both stopped. They coughed. They stared at different corners of the room.

>Finally, Stephen said “So I was a bit of an ass.”

>“A bit, yeah.”

>“For that, I’m very sorry. Can I do something to make it up to you?”

>“Well, you could get me out of here.”

>“Working on that.” He shoved a hand through his hair. “But I’d try to do that anyway. Are you sure there isn’t anything else? Vigil on my knees, perhaps?”

>“I don’t think I need anything vigilled. Is that even a word?”

>“No, but we can make it one.”

>Grace gave him that crooked smile, marred only by a suspicious shine to her eyes. “But you found me. How did you know?”

It bothers me because it reflects an unhealthy perspective that a woman is entitled to be pleased and pursued and that the man's agency and comfort don't matter.  If the genders were reversed -- and it were Grace hitting the brakes because of her past trauma, ending up in the doghouse because she ""wronged"" Stephen by not giving him what he wanted --I'm sure a lot more readers would be uncomfortable with the situation.  

Again, I liked most of the book; it's really only this one element that rubbed me the wrong way.  But I was disheartened to make it through the rest of the story without any self-reflection on Grace's part, acknowledgement of how Stephen's trauma gave him cold feet, or how unfairly Grace reacted in shutting down the conversation and treating Stephen's action as a personal offense.

books,"GoodReads vs Storygraph, Or, the story of how I went back to Goodreads after months of trying to get used to Storygraph","My name is Hadar, 30, and have been using Goodreads since my teens. This has really not been my favorite platform and I've been looking for an alternative for a while, until I stumbled over Storygraph in this very reddit.

Important details:

* While my native language is Hebrew and I sometimes read in Chinese, I read mostly in English.
* I do not pay much attention to what book edition I am marking on the website (some books have been marked in the wrong language/format, and I never bothered to fix it).



For the first few weeks, Storygraph was great- direct and intuitive interface, the data migration was convenient and fast, everything was great.

It immediately shows you nice visualizations of your favorite book types/topics/whatsnot, which is really nice to see and analyze yourself.

My favorite part was that it kept reminding me of books on my to-read list in random order, which is great for balancing book genres/periods.



But then I wanted to read a new book. in order to compare some books, I found myself going back to Goodreads to read some reviews, given Storygraph had less than 10 readers for it. I did make it on Storygraph, but then the unimaginable happened:



I wanted to read a non-English book.



Looking for books in Hebrew or Chinese, I realized how narrow the database really was. While some books existed in translated versions, some books simply weren't there.

It seemed understandable- as a platform with fewer users, maybe adding the book to the database could be my small contribution to it! (The book in question is a Chinese book by a Taiwanese author).

I tried both their app and website, encountering issues every time. I get that verifying books is a complicated process and they don't want to allow everyone to do that. There is a form to add all the details including the ISBN and everything. But as a reader, This non-functionality was frustrating, understanding how Storygraph might not be able to follow up with all my readings due to this behavior. After about a month of a dosen failures, I gave up on trying to add this book; or use Storygraph overall.



While Goodreads interface is not as smart as Storygraph, their database is simply more comprehensive. Whether it's reading in foreign languages or just checking up on a random book you encountered, having it on their database with such many reviews, even if I end up disagreeing with the review, is still a start.

books,Beneath a Scarlet Sky by Mark Sullivan,"Have had this on my bookshelf for nearly 10 years and decided to give it a go as I’ve banned myself from buying new books until I finish the ones I already have. 

The premise is very interesting (Italian resistance during WW2) and the reviews for this on goodreads and on reddit are glowing. However, I’m DNFing at 200 pages. 

The writing feels so clunky and unrefined. For example, there is one scene where the protagonist is helping a pregnant Jewish lady cross over the Alps into Switzerland and the dialogue is literally her going “Ahhh!!” and “Wheeee!” as they go down a mountain slope. You can definitely tell this was self-published. I looked into it more and the only accolades it received was “No 1 on the Amazon charts” which feels strange for such a highly rated book. 

Pino’s story is fascinating (whether or not it’s actually a true story) but the quality of writing just reads like fan-fiction.

books,Has anyone else read Disorientation by Elaine Hsieh Chou?,"I LOVED this book and no one I know has read it and I am dying to talk about it.

books,Fairy Tale by Stephen King – A masterpiece or just rehashing the same thing,"Hi everyone! I just finished reading *Fairy Tale* by Stephen King yesterday, and while I really enjoyed it (I love King’s style and his characters, so it’s hard for me not to like one of his books), I’ve started to notice a certain repetitiveness in his recent works.

Let me explain: even though the settings, plots, and various narrative elements change, his protagonists always seem to share very similar traits. On one hand, I don’t mind this because I easily grow attached to that kind of character, but on the other, I worry that over time it might become predictable and therefore less engaging.

Am I the only one who feels this way? Has anyone else noticed this trend in his books?",113,127,2025-04-01 16:53:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1joxk97/fairy_tale_by_stephen_king_a_masterpiece_or_just/

Slowly, the magic and menace of the white walkers is unveiled, as well as getting a hint at the political system of Westeros. All this right before shit gets real and you watch the raiding party get cut down one by one all until the last is all alone… and one of the fallen figures gets back up.

books,"Just killed my TBR pile, feels liberating!","It has been a while that I realized backlogs (for videogames), lists of tv shows and TBR piles (for books and comics) were not good for me. So I have been actively working on not having them. I will focus on the TBR for books here.

Around 4 years back I sold everything that I decided I was not going to read in the next 3 years, with very few exceptions (Tolkien stays, no matter what, and a handful of personal favorites). Then proceeded to just read what I had pending and already purchased, and allowed me to incorporate one new item only after having read at least 2 of the other items. Often after having read more than 2.

Every time I finished one of the books I would ask myself ""am I going to read this again in the next 3 years?"" if the answer was not a clear ""YES"", then away it went, no remorse. Out. Right now I must own only like 25 physical books, including comics. Nicely displayed. 4 years ago I had boxes of them in a basement.

Last weekend I started to read the last book on my TBR pile, which is Dracula and actually is a re-read, because I read it 2 years ago and liked it so much I gave it away and bought a nicer edition. Once I finish it in a couple of weeks, I will not have anything else waiting to be next, and it feels GOOD. No more going through a book with the pressure of having to finish it so I can read the next ones waiting. I will just enjoy my book and then be able to pick my next book when the moment to start it comes, and I will be able to pick whatever book I feel like reading on that moment, not feeling pressured by something I chose 1 year ago when I was feeling like reading something different than I feel like reading today.

To each their own, but to me is making my reading experience much enjoyable. And I apply it to other things, as said, tv shows, videogames, etc",197,49,2025-04-01 08:36:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1jop5na/just_killed_my_tbr_pile_feels_liberating/

books,An Obvious PSA: Use the Library,"I honestly feel a bit embarrassed even writing this post. Part of me feels like everyone here already knows all of this. However, I am a lifelong reader, and I’m just realizing this in my late twenties, so maybe there are others here who could use the gentle reminder:

Libraries are amazing and we should make the effort to use them! 

I’m someone who is on booktok/booktube a lot and who is constantly, impulsively buying books to keep up with trends. I used to believe that I was building my home library (and I have no judgement towards anyone who wishes to do that). However, I personally found that I was rarely returning to books, other than a few favorites, and the books in my home were just taking up a lot of space after I’d finished them. Additionally, I often fell into the trap of buying off of amazon because it was so quick and easy (again, no judgement if you do this).

As a teacher who doesn’t make much, this was really starting to impact me financially. 

I went to my local library yesterday and so many of the books I’ve bought in the last few years—that I’ve probably spent hundreds of dollars on—were there for free. 🤡
Plus my library has audiobooks available through libby (and yet, I was paying for audible—goofy).


I think in capitalistic societies, many people buy/consume on default instead of looking for other means of obtaining what they wish. For me, this extended to reading. I knew libraries were there, of course. But I sort of forgot they were an option, and I got so hooked on the dopamine rush of visiting bookstores or getting books in the mail that I forgot to even check the library.

Libraries are such important pillars of communities.They provide free services and allow so many to have access to books they couldn’t otherwise experience.  Not to mention letting people use the internet, providing ESL lessons, and doing a lot of other community outreach (depending on the location). We should support them.

True, you sometimes have to wait to get your hands on the next, big book. But you might find something else—maybe something that wasn’t even on your radar—to read while you wait.

What are some of the reasons you visit the library?

books,I just read The Outsiders for the first time and cried for the last 30 pages,"

Insane how much emotion can be packed into a book meant for middle schoolers. I'm almost glad I didn't read it in school because it just wouldn't have hit as hard. 

It's amazing to me also that SE Hinton began writing the book when she was only sixteen. I feel like that adds so much more legitimacy to what Ponyboy was feeling. While reading it I did partially think that it was a lot of adult emotion imposed on teenage characters but that's really not the case. It's very much a firsthand experience.

It's both sad and amazing how relevant it still feels today, too. Even with some outdated language the overall themes translate so well. ",566,91,2025-03-30 23:31:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1jnn7ts/i_just_read_the_outsiders_for_the_first_time_and/
books,"Our Riches, by Kaouther Adimi (2017)","This book was originally in French:  Nos richesses.  As far as I can tell from the author's Wikipedia page, it has won five awards in that language.

And it's hard to say why.  Although I can certainly feel its value.  It's at least partly a love letter to Algiers, in the same way Patrick Modiano's Honeymoon is a love letter to Paris.  It's not the whole story, but it's a big part of it.  No doubt the translator (Chris Andrews) is at least partly responsible for this success.

Which is a bit odd, since the author only lived in Algeria 15 or so of her grownup years.  She moved there in 1994, and left in 2009.  She lives in Paris.

Geez... I came here to recommend it strongly and I can't seem to get it done!  lol it lightened my heart.  It did.  It's a bit like Eugene Onegin:  scenes from a life.  I won't read it again, but I'm glad to have read it once.  

I guess part of the attraction is, it tells you the story is unimportant.  It makes that case pretty strongly and pretty well.  Whatever is going on, you'll get over it or you won't, and the fact that the fact that that result won't matter much isn't the most important fact is an important fact.

Woah.  Yes, that's what I said.  Somebody slap me.

Sorry.  It was a pretty good book tho.  I recommend it highly.",9,2,2025-03-31 18:37:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1jo7jwf/our_riches_by_kaouther_adimi_2017/

books,The ressurectionist by A Rae Dunlap,"I just finished this and it’s excellent. I’ll keep this spoiler free but set in Edinburgh in the mid 1800’s, it’s incredibly atmospheric and really plants you in the time and the place. It’s a fiction set amongst real events (of which o know about but others might not) and there was a moment where I saw what was coming and had to put the book down for a minute whilst I mulled over where I knew it was going. Not having the context however will definitely not spoil this read, it’s a neo 19th C story and an absolutely riveting read.

books,Wicked For Good [Movie tie-in]: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West by Gregory Maguire,"Come read the second half of the book you were tricked into buying last time because the cover made you think it had anything to do with the movie! Relive all your favorite scenes between Elphaba and Glinda where they… oh wait, they’re not in there. How about the one where—nope, that didn’t happen either.

**Catch up** with Glinda as she sips tea with Fiyero, who she hasn’t seen in half a decade, and a character named Crope—whose absence from the musical definitely had nothing to do with his overt homosexuality, guys, you’ve gotta stop saying that! They’re here to inform you that Glinda is now married to a geriatric man you never meet, and that Crope’s ex-boyfriend Tibbett got (not AIDS) from a tiger at the clerb.

**Feel Delicious**\-ly confused as Elphaba has an affair with married Fiyero in front of a cat that probably can’t talk… right? All while simultaneously committing acts of terrorism, animal liberation, and political sabotage—seasoned with a healthy dose of paranoia. Then **BAM!** Seven years pass. And **BAM AGAIN!** Another chunk of time disappears. No transitions. No explanation. Just emotional whiplash, vibes and a secret baby in the cabbage patch.

**Attend!** As soldiers describe what they plan to do to Dorothy, a literal child, while she skips down the Yellow Brick Road like a human natural disaster. Did the song “For Good” make you cry? Good. Now get ready to laugh and scream in confusion as Elphaba sets herself on fire and is then murdered.

**Marvel** as Dorothy cradles the Wicked Witch in her arms while she literally melts to death. Is Dorothy okay? Probably not. Did Kansas have mental health support for 10-year-old girls in 1900? Unclear.

Buy it now with the MOVIE COVER so everyone knows you came here for musical fluff and stayed for the war crimes!

⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

“What do you mean seven years have passed?”

Thought this was gonna be a cute story about friendship and defying gravity. Instead, I got war, death, political unrest, WHY DID HE HAVE SEX WITH THAT TIGER?!?, and a woman slowly losing her mind in a tower. No songs. No sparkles. Just vibes and trauma. Loved it!

[Edit: To clarify for the strange amount of people who need it —this is a satire post poking fun at the wild disconnect between the Wicked musical/movie and the original book. I’m a fan of both! This is meant to entertain, not attack. Please don’t take it too seriously.]",100,38,2025-03-30 17:50:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1jnfe2p/wicked_for_good_movie_tiein_the_life_and_times_of/

For me, in 2025, when I travel I don’t need physical travel guidebooks anymore.

books,For those who love Stoner...,"I would love to have a discussion and get to know your perspective and learn what it is you loved about this book. I have seen so many people praise Stoner, calling it their best book of the year and one of the best books ever written, so my expectations were very high. I thought I was going to love it just like everyone else. 

But unfortunately, I didn't. I thought it was very boring. I found the characters quite insubstantial, flat, passive, and lacking personality, and the narration was mostly dry and lifeless. The story didn't evoke any feelings in me, even though it is usually described as being very sad. I felt very distant from both the story and Stoner himself, so it was hard for me to actually care. I think Dave Masters described Stoner perfectly when he said that he was cut out for failure  and that he would never fight the world, because he was just so passive throughout the novel. The only chapters I truly liked were the two in which Stoner and Katherine Driscoll were together. The rest was so monotonous to me.

I didn't hate the book (I gave it 3 stars), but since my expectations weren't met, I feel very disappointed. I know it's okay not to love a book that others do, but since I was expecting to love it myself, I guess I just want to know what people loved about it, to see what it is that I could have felt had I loved it like I had expected to. Maybe I can gain some appreciation through others' perspectives, or at least understand the love for this book.",0,34,2025-03-31 09:52:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1jnxztz/for_those_who_love_stoner/
books,Thoughts on Metro 2033?,"I finished the audiobook about a month ago. Not everything is fresh in my mind, but I'll try to do my best.

I'll start by saying that I'm generally not much of a reader of postapocalyptic tales. I read however The Stand a few years ago, and I enjoyed it very much. The first half I enjoyed better than the second, but they were both good.

I've also read the first 3 books in the Dark Tower series, and I generally enjoyed them. Didn't really think much of Gunslinger, but the other 2 entries were solid.

I can't think of any other similar books I've read, but I know I eventually want to read The Road. I've watched the movie, though.

Point is, Metro 2033 is outside of my comfort zone. So, bear that in mind.

For the most part, I would say that I generally enjoyed Metro 2033. I liked its premise a lot. And I liked Artyom a lot too. Artyom is the story.

Artyom really feels like the only character in the book that isn't completely insane. And, it's very easy to relate to him.

His intentions are noble. His goals are near impossible to achieve. And, his adventures are riddled with obstacles.

The world-building in the book is both fascinating as it is cruel. Society has become an underground killzone, and quite frankly, I find it difficult to believe they haven't all killed each other with how often people die in front of Artiom.

The other characters he meets on his way are appropriately crazy and selfish, which is why they are perfect for the world of Metro 2033.

I don't know if it's correct to complain about how often Artyom is saved by sheer luck or difficult to understand phenomena, but it really is a miracle that he was even able to complete his mission.

And then there's the bittersweet finale that makes you want more, even though it renders the whole adventure pointless. I'm still not sure how to feel about that. I don't know if it's genius or dumb, but it's certainly something.

All in all, I would say that, even though Metro 2033 isn't my type of book, it's a solid entry, and I would like to continue with the series eventually.",15,22,2025-03-30 20:11:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1jnilkh/thoughts_on_metro_2033/

books,Review of A Book Of Luminous Things by Czeslaw Milosz,"Overall I'd give this book 3.5 or 4 stars out of 5.

This anthology (mostly) goes with the theme of light-hearted, happy poems. All of the poems in this book are short, and have a small chunk of commentary before the poem.

I enjoyed this poetry anthology. There were some poems I wouldn't say are bad, but I was bored by because they weren't my style. This happened a lot with the classical Chinese poetry in the book. There are some Christian poems, and his commentary makes it clear that he is Christian. Do with that information what you will. My personal favorite poems from this book are:

The Same Inside by Anna Swir 

Golden Bells by Po Chü-I

books,"""The Little House"" books imprinted on me an image of the US that despite all the evidence to the contrary, I can never really imagine the US as anything else.","Laura Ingalls Wilder succeeded in her mission to create a national narrative about the US and the pioneer life perhaps a bit too well, at least when it came to me. 

I read the books when I was very young, and I think they were probably the first American books I had read. Raised on a steady of British kids' book, E Nesbit, Narnia, Tolkien, Prydain, the Little House books seemed I suppose just another charming fantasy, except of course it wasn't.

Who can forget eating a barbecued pig's tail? Ma's strawberry print dress? Pa and the fiddle? Laura's joy at receiving an orange for Christmas? The dug-out room they lived in, like beavers, by the creek? Pa building a little house on the prairies with his bare hands and an ax, Ma helping, then a log rolling down and hitting her, and Pa shouting ""Caroline!"" in a terrible voice? The train ride? Their books? The red book of Tennyson's poetry Laura found, a later Christmas present? I still seem to replay those scenes regularly in my head. It was all so wonderful, and yet so unlike the luxe wealth and crass consumerism which modern media assures us Americans are enjoying these days. What happened?

books,"A theory about ""We Have Always Lived in the Castle"" by Shirley Jackson","Merricat has been dead the whole time. 

The idea came from Uncle Julian. Uncle Julian is clearly senile, but like many senile people, he has periods in which he is lucid and present and understands what is going on around him. The first strange thing I noticed is that even in his lucid moments, Uncle Julian doesn't address Merricat. Not even once. I think the author is very deliberately calling our attention to this because Uncle Julian is constantly calling Constance by name to ask her a question or request that she do this or that for him. But he never so much as mentions Merricat, not even to Constance, or acknowledges her existence in any way, even though she is always underfoot. 

The second strange thing is something Uncle Julian said to Charles when Charles mentioned Merricat: “My niece Mary Katherine has been a long time dead [...] My niece Mary Katherine died in an orphanage, of neglect, during her sister's trial for murder.” This could be dismissed as the confused rambling of a senile man but other than this one instance, Uncle Julian never says anything that is factually incorrect. True, like many senile people he often relives the events of the past and thinks people around him are people from his past, but he's never said anything that wasn't at one point true. So if Uncle Julian doesn't say things that aren't true, and he says that Merricat died a long time ago, the logical conclusion is that Merricat is dead. 

Here's what I think happened: After she murdered her family and Constance was arrested, Merricat was taken to an orphanage where she has said she was miserable. As an autistic person, I read Merricat as very autistic as well. This book was published in 1962, a time at which neurodivergent people were misunderstood and mistreated. It's not hard to imagine Merricat being neglected and even abused in the orphanage, and it's sadly not hard to imagine a child dying from that. 

Constance, meanwhile, was on trial for a mass murder she knew full well Merricat had committed. The fact that Merricat deliberately spared her (Constance never put sugar on her blackberries so Merricat put the poison in the sugar) and the fact that Constance was willing to literally risk her life for Merricat by allowing herself to be put on trial instead of giving up the true killer speaks to the incredible strength of the bond between the sisters. Imagine, then, the grief she must have felt upon leaving the courtroom after being acquitted only to learn that the sister she risked her life to save was already dead. I think in that moment the strength of her grief and love and guilt brought Merricat's ghost back. 

This would explain a few things. First, on paper Merricat is eighteen but she acts nothing like an eighteen-year-old. She still believes in magic, burying treasure and speaking magic words to keep her house and her family safe. She hides in hollows under bushes and talks to her cat. In short, she acts like a child and is treated like a child by Constance. And maybe that's because she is. Maybe she hasn't aged a day since the trial because she isn't a flesh-and-blood person but a projection of Constance's memory of her, forever frozen at twelve years old. Second, once Charles comes along and starts trying to convince Constance to leave the house and live a normal life, she keeps expressing regret about how she's failed to move on from the tragedy, at one point telling Merricat “And you–” but doesn't finish her sentence. Later she does say, “And you should have boy friends,” which sounds utterly absurd even to her. But what if she wanted to say, “And you, I should have let you rest.”? What if what we're seeing is Constance feeling guilty for keeping her dead sister tethered to this world because she can't bear to let go? 

And finally back to Uncle Julian: why is he the only one who can't see Merricat? Because he's the only person around who knows what actually happened. The townspeople don't know the truth and they don't want to. They've gotten it into their heads that Constance is a murderer and, acquittal or no acquittal, nothing is going to change their minds. Their close-mindedness is what allows the illusion to work on them. Similarly, Charles is only here for money. He doesn't know what happened to the family and he doesn't care. But Uncle Julian knows. He's the only one for miles around who actually knows what happened to Merricat and he's the only person left who knew her personally so he can't be tricked into thinking she's still alive. It is clear that Constance knows this too, because she doesn't mention Merricat to him any more than he mentions her. 

Is this what Jackson had in mind when she wrote the book? I have no idea. But it's an interesting theory.

books,Underappreciated Series: Abarat by Clive Barker,"The Abarat series by Clive Barker is one of the most underrated fantasy series I've ever had the pleasure of reading. 


The first book begins with a girl named Candy wandering beyond the limits of her landlocked Minnesota town only to stumbled into the middle of an intense fight between an otherworldly thief and the assassin chasing him. Before she knows it, she has summoned a magical sea that sweeps her away to the Abarat, a world where each hour is an island filled with the stuff of dreams - or nightmares. As Candy explores the many wonders of the Abarat, long buried secrets - including her own impossible connection to the fantastical world - come to light, and unlikely heroes step forth to face down terrors the likes of which neither their world - or ours - have ever seen. 


The series is both whimsical and dark (increasingly so with each book). It's incredibly unique and beautifully illustrated with oil paintings made by the author himself.


So far, only three of the planned five books have been released; there is now, officially, a George R.R. Martin-sized gap since book three was released, BUT Barker recently indicated that he's planning to take a break from conventions and other things that have caused a delay in his writing - apparently books four and five should be forthcoming!

books,How do you preserve and revisit quotes from books?,"Hello everyone,
We often come across sentences or paragraphs in books that really resonate with us - whether it’s a beautiful quote, something that’s particularly enlightening, or just a line that really sticks with us. When reading physical books, it’s easy to use a bookmark or jot down notes in the margins. But when it comes to reading on a Kindle or other e-readers, how do you save these memorable quotes in a way that’s readily accessible? 
Do you rely on Kindle's highlight feature, or do you prefer keeping a separate diary or journal for this purpose? Is it worth maintaining one, or does it end up feeling like a hassle? I’d love to hear how others keep track of those special lines!

Looking forward to your thoughts and advice.

books,Review of Anthem by Ayn Rand,"Overall I'd give this book 3.5 or 4 stars out of 5.

I think this book is built off of a slippery slope fallacy in the way that it tries to be a commentary on communism and socialism >!by portraying everyone as part of the collective, and there being no individualism. One way in which the author does this is by not using personal pronouns for most of the book, but fails to actually portray people as all together, because people are often still referred to as individuals with names.!< This book is also extremely in favor of individualism in a way I do not agree with. I personally think there should be a healthy balance of individualism and working together for the common good. The person who lent me this book told me how the author is very in favor of everyone working for themselves, and leaving others alone, and this is fairly clear in the book. Although I don't like the message of this book, I did really enjoy the story itself. I think it is written extremely well, and some parts have their own individual message that I liked. My only two problems with the book are the parts where the underlying message is obnoxiously clear, and >!how there's a five year age gap romance.!<",0,17,2025-03-31 01:32:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1jnps9q/review_of_anthem_by_ayn_rand/
books,Right Place Right Time Book,"What books have you read that you just happened to be reading at the exact right time and place in your life?

I just had this experience reading 100 Years of Solitude which I read it's entirety while cleaning out my parent's house.  This was the only house I had for my entire childhood and since I now live abroad I knew I would never step foot in it again.  Having to spend a week cleaning out all the things from my childhood, my brothers' belongings, my parents' keepsakes, and many other random knick knacks from other relatives and past generations that had been stored and untouched since before I was even born was a trip.  By the end of the book I was crying, it was so odd reading about this family and their homes history while I was doing the same thing for myself.  Really can't think of any book that mirrored my current state and activities more and it really helped me reflect on what was happening.

books,What is the book that took you a couple tries before it clicked?,"I find myself to be a fickle reader sometimes, where I’ll find books that from either the synopsis or a friend’s recommendation interest me, but when I start reading it takes me multiple attempts to get past the first few pages, even if I end up loving the book! I attribute it in large part to ADHD but sometimes a book is just a tough read until it gets its hooks in me. 

One book that really is doing this to me right now is Perdido Street Station by China Miéville. I really am fascinated by the world he creates in the story so far but I’ve tried reading it a few times now and I’ve never gotten farther than the first 100 pages. I love Weird Fiction and his writing is very well done, but all the world building, while done well, is hard for me to get super into, and I’m wanting to get on with the plot that he’s started!! 

The biggest saving grace is that the world building is reminding me of the Ambergris Trilogy by Jeff VanderMeer and I LOVED those books even though the first book of that trilogy also took some work to get into. 

I’m curious, what books have been like this for you and what are your strategies for overcoming this issue?",158,317,2025-03-28 18:07:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1jm01jo/what_is_the_book_that_took_you_a_couple_tries/
books,Just For the Summer by Abby Jimenez is amazing,"Just finished the book, and I have to admit I was blown away by it.


Most of the booktubers I follow, deemed this as boring and while I do agree that for about 90 pages nothing really happens, it really picks up the pace from the 100 mark.The characters were so loveable though flawed. And I loved how patient both leads were with each other. 


But my favourite part of it was the commentery on love and relationships. Emma growing to learn how to love properly and Justin learning how to be more forgiving and empathetic, really spoke to me, like i couldnt help but see myself in them. The way it navigated Emmas trauma was also great imo, how she took accountability for her actions and did not really use the trauma as an excuse. I loved how everything wasnt okay immedietly and that it took her time to figure things out.

writing,State of the Sub,"Hello to everyone!

It's hard to believe it's roughly a year since we had a major refresh of our mod team, rules, etc, but here we are. It's been long enough now for everyone to get a sense of where we've been going and have opinions on that. Some of them we've seen in various meta threads, others have been modmails, and others are perceptions we as mods have from our experiences interacting with the subreddit and the wonderful community you guys are. However, every writer knows how important it is to seek feedback, and it's time for us to do just that. I'll start by laying out what we've seen or been informed of, some different brainstormed solutions/ways ahead, and then look for your feedback!

If we missed something, please let us know here. If you have other solutions, same!

> 1) Beginner questions

Our subreddit, r/writing, is the easiest subreddit for new writers to find. We always will be. And we want to strike a balance between supporting every writer (especially new writers) on their journey, and controlling how many times topics come up. We are resolved to remain welcoming to new writers, even when they have questions that feel repetitive to those of us who've done this for ages.

**Ideas going forward**

- Major FAQ and Wiki refresh (this is long-term, unless we can get community volunteers to help) based on what gets asked regularly on the sub, today.

- More generalized, mini-FAQ automod removal messages for repetitive/beginner questions.

- Encouraging the more experienced posters to remember what it was like when they were in the same position, and extend that grace to others.

- Ideas?

> 2) Weekly thread participation

We get it; the weekly threads aren't seeing much activity, which makes things frustrating. However, we regularly have days where we as a mod team need to remove 4-9 threads on exactly the same topic. We've heard part of the issue is how mobile interacts with stickied threads, and we are limited in our number of stickied threads. Therefore, we've come up with a few ideas on how to address this, balancing community patience and the needs of newer writers.

**Ideas**

- Change from daily to weekly threads, and make them designed for general/brainstorming.

- Create a monthly critique thread for sharing work. (one caveat here is that we've noticed a lot of people who want critique but are unwilling to give critique. We encourage the community to take advantage of the opportunity to improve their self-editing skills by critiquing others' work!)

- Redirect all work sharing to r/writers, which has become primarily for that purpose (we do not favor this, because we think that avoids the community need rather than addressing it)

> 3) You're too ruthless/not ruthless enough with removals.

Yes, we regularly get both complaints. More than that, we understand both complaints, especially given the lack of traffic to the daily threads. However, we recently had a two-week period where most of our (small) team wound up unavailable for independent, personal reasons. I think it's clear from the numbers of rule-breaking and reported threads that 'mod less' isn't an answer the community (broadly) wants.

**Ideas**

- Create a better forum for those repetitive questions

- Better FAQ

- Look at a rule refresh/update (which we think we're due for, especially if we're changing how the daily/weekly threads work)

> 4) Other feedback!

At this point, I just want to open the thread to you as a community. The more variety of opinions we receive, the better we can see what folks are considering, and come up with collaborative solutions that actually meet what you want, rather than doing what we think might meet what we think you want! Please offer up anything else you've seen happening, ideally with a solution or two.",177,123,2025-02-20 05:09:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/1itpqoy/state_of_the_sub/

\* Type of feedback desired (line-by-line edits, general impression, etc.)

\* A link to the writing

For anyone using Google Drive for critique: Drive is one of the easiest ways to share and comment on work, but keep in mind all activity is tied to your Google account and may reveal personal information such as your full name. If you plan to use Google Drive as your critique platform, consider creating a separate account solely for sharing writing that does not have any connections to your real-life identity.

&#x200B;

Be reasonable with expectations. Posting a short chapter or a quick excerpt will get you many more responses than posting a full work. Everyone's stamina varies, but generally speaking the more you keep it under 5,000 words the better off you'll be.

writing,The Posts On This Sub Verge On Parody,"Rant but it seems like this sub has so many issues. Every other post on this sub seems to be an asinine question (i.e. can I put \*thing\* in my story) as if there's a definitive guide on what you can and can't do in a book. You can do anything, and usually the answer boils down to: do you do it well? Even then, it doesn't NEED to have an exact purpose. Not every single scene and action needs to serve a direct relation to the plot. That is not how most TV, film or novels are written. Character development is arguably just as important.

On top of this: No, you can't publish 45 pages of unedited text and call it a ""novel"". You can't expect your book to be published by a major house without representation. You aren't going to be able to publish a thousand page fantasy epic that's entirely exposition for your upcoming trilogy as your debut.

This post will probably get deleted but I don't care.  This sub is flooded with endless posts of complete nonsense, which is a damn shame because a sub like this *IS* useful.

writing,Buffy Summers = An (good) exemple of the strong female character,"There has been a trend where the ""strong female character"" is just mean, brooding and rude to people for no reason. I saw a rent of that on this sub and I agreed with every complaining of it. 

Buffy Summers is the protagonist of the show Buffy The Vampire Slayer and an iconic character in pop culture. The concept of the show was basically ""what if a Valley girl/cheerleader became a vampire slayer"". So, Buffy wasn't the ""I'm not like other girls"" type of girl. She was girly, liked to go shopping, talking about boys and clothes all night long etc... She was kind-hearted, upbeat, outgoing, and stylish. She was also confident in herself without being too cocky either. She was witty with always the right one-liner but she could also be a little clumsy, bossy and impulsive at times. She was also quick to put two and two together but she wasn't a brain like Willow or Giles. She was a loyal friend, always there for people and standing up for them. She could be harsh on people sometimes but she always had compassion for others. She had her morals straight. 

I was just watching a rom-com called ""Picture this"" and OMG. It's always the same female character. The ""I don't want a relationship, I want to be independant"" kind of character. And don't get me wrong, it's good to want to be independant but you have to have something else to back it up. I was watching this and I was like ""women are nuanced, I promise"". She was complete train-rack but somehow she was praised for it in the movie. And again, I'm not against messy character, but only if the fault are intentional and then acknoledge by the writers. Devi from Never Have I Ever is a proof of that since she's problematic but it's a part of her arc and is supposed to help her story move forward. 

Buffy was allowed to be strong and indepedant but also vulnerable and in need of help. She could be bratty but still stay gentle and kind. ",20,46,2025-04-06 13:42:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/1jss844/buffy_summers_an_good_exemple_of_the_strong/
writing,A fantasy with no forced drama is my new favourite.,"Yes, I have been thinking about a world that is not so much filled with horror and other wicked stuff, just plain normal humans with other fantastical kinds, peaceful and normal to that world. I think about making a story that isn't following some great conflict through the plot but just a normal life of many characters, who are engaged in daily lives and adventures of seeing the world and meeting new people and kinds, not fulfilling any prophecy or ending any curse or fighting a dark lord, no, none of that.

It may not be that dramatic as usually a fantasy is, but it will have wars and other political threads sewn underneath, running as the characters go on about their lives.

I am writing a fantasy and it is very dramatic with everything that I said it should not have, and the idea for a peaceful fantasy came from it actually. There's a place in my world called the Heartlake, at the center of the kingdom with five noble houses surrounding it, the sons of the lake, they are called. At the depths of the lake are found precious stones that are sold for high prices. Now about 25 years before the start of the main story, that place was crowded with people all around the world, living their lives to the fullest, diving into the lake and enjoying peaceful times but then a war happens and everything turns to... you know.

So I thought of writing a prequel to the main story about that place where some characters from the oast will visit it and all. And I will but I thought why not write a whole different fantasy with a world where there's no drama as a usual fantasy would have. Why not keep it as simple as it can be, like a show that never ends, showing lives of characters and then their children and then theirs in turn, and on and on it goes. I know it's kinda stupid but I really want to just live in the fantasy world for an escape, not to find more drama there. Yes I love drama and I love it great but I also want to things go easy and let me just live in the world with everyone.

writing,To hack or not to hack,"I’m writing a post apocalyptic story told through an interview/oral history style via interviews, social media posts, recorded meetings, web cams, ect. Similar to Robopocalypse or World War Z. 

An event affects the whole world, leading to a limited nuclear war. Initially I was going to have a UN commission assign a job to someone to gather up all the related story info told through people all over the world. 

In this story the event is caused by a satellite weapons array. I don’t want the system to be hackable, so I wasn’t planning on using hackers. But now part of me wants to use a hacker to be the one to gather all the stories to put together to give to the public. It would make it easier to explain why someone might have info that normally wouldn’t make it to the public domain. Some of the info would be security, camera records or secret government clips. Stuff that would be hard to get or unexpected sources. 

The idea of use the UN was that they would be neutral ground to put the story together. That countries would be open to providing said material needed in the name of rebuilding the world. 

So other then a hacker being the one the put together the stories, they wouldn’t serve any other purpose. They would play no part in the event itself. So I guess my question is do I forget the hacker or how do I find other purpose to incorporate them into the story?

writing,Immoral characters?,"Try to come into this with no judgment. I am currently working on a new story slightly inspired by a romanticization of some my own life events. (none of this actually happened, but there are times where the thought has crossed my mind and I felt like a character undergoing such events would be interesting).
Let’s just say the TLDR is that the characters have an unexplored connection but due to other live choices they end up not being together. 
This leads to them later rekindling things – but there is a slight issue. One of them is in a relationship. 
As a victim of pretty aggressive cheating, I would never condone those actions in real life – however I understand what it feels like to regret giving up the chance to be with someone. The person who inspired the story is someone who I would romantically be interested in if he was not taken . The opportunity existed prior to his relationship, but because of other things going on, I did not pursue it I’m not a shitty person – but I wouldn’t mind if my character was ;)
Of course there are other things that allow them to feel less guilty about him cheating on his partner. (The story involves a lot of suspense as they are both part of an elaborate coup) so I see in some way it could be a “fuck it” moment as he knows he may not survive?
I guess I’m asking for some advice. How would you recommend writing cheating? The concept of immoral attraction/ forbidden fruit is one I would like to attempt to write about.
I’ve read some other forums and people mostly say that it is a negative thing and regardless of the reason, readers may be turned off by it. Which I agree – but we see it in television that people cheat, and it eventually gets brushed under the rug for the sake of the plot.

Every novel has the main plot, some subplots, and some promises given by foreshadowing, or dialogues regarding lore, or anything else glimpsed during the novel, requiring answers and resolutions. For example, the main plot is to find the treasure in the dungeon.

At the same time, MC's past is explored through dialogues and exposition, revealing his motivations, the reason why he wants the treasures, and so on.

Should all these threads be resolved by the end of the novel? Should all the lore have some use in the novel, be involved in plot or character development?

So for further cotext of my situation I've been having health... Lets say complications since two years, so in the hospitals I was before and the situations I was before I had an enviorment that allowed me to write insane amounts of words. The summer was my writing peak(I guees that exist?) I was for two months with nothing to do but stare at my computer and read, but I had an objective, finish the novel while this health thing goes away. We are talking 3000 words per day for most of the days of the 50 I was in this situation. I finished the novel, with sort of a hustle because I was sick of the characters and all and wanted to do something different. On 27/8/24 I finished my first novel with the word count of 82k words. And started brainstorming for the next one, or so I thought, the second was supposed to be a complement to another world of time travelling vamparies and bloodlines, the start of everything type of story. So that story was kinda of a romance, wich I needed for the started of a bloodline of timetraveler vampires. And absolutly hated writing it, well, not hate itself but the conflict, which was getting the 2 characters together and give them their powers, which was the climax of the story took me 6 chapters, and the story ended with 18k words of so. Then came motivation againg, world building. 
I starded worldbuilding while writing the last history, and in the meantime writing the second draft of the first novel. Not writing that much back in november-december but stil 1000-800 words per day. The worldbuilding was a fantasy world(as no one has done before :)), then, when I finished the story of the vampires and after a month of worldbuilding I started writing a chronicles, i don't know if that's how u say it. The chronicles of one of the houses of the world. That has a world count of maybe 45k now, I don't really remember. But then i got in a moment of the chronicles and I have started writing a story, I dont wanna call it a nothing because Im a fucking mess and won't get it to a good ending like the 1st novel wich the ending felt like I had to deliver it in a day to a publisher. 

Well, the questions after the fucking bible up there:
The first novel I really like, and wanna have it polished, but I really have to hurry? 
This thing/story that has come at the chronicles, is a distraction or should I also wrote that?

writing,Help a Writer with OCD,"Hey All,

I am a first time poster here. I am actually a screenwriter but I figure it's a form of writing. I am really struggling with my intense OCD that keeps telling me I am a terrible, morally bad writer for plagiarizing my favorite show and I'd love to get a gut reaction/advice. Here's my particular case:

\*I love the show Ghosts on CBS. One of the main ghosts is a haughty Gilded Age housewife who killed herself (by hanging with a phone cord) to save her family fortune for her son when her husband committed shady financial dealings that caught the attention of the law. She is currently in a relationship with another ghost, a Wall Street stock broker.

\*I didn't realize that my show has oddly similar elements. In my script that is set in the 70s, my main character is a finance- adjacent guy who used to work for a big debt/insurance investor but now is just an operations manager for a tech data company (not Wall Street). The premise of my show is that my protagonist's artsy wife left behind tons of debts and then committed suicide by drowning in a sink, all without telling my protagonist. In my show, the wife doesn't actually appear as a character. Her death is instead just exposition.

Is my premise too similar? Am I just being too critical of myself? I kind of went into my pilot script recalling the same suicide theme from Ghosts but totally forgetting about the relationship with corporate professional guy aspect. \*Additionally, the personalities of my characters are completely different.

The reason it took so long was that I had a copywriting side-hustle and it exhausted me. Writing all day long left me feeling too tired for writing for myself, so I didn't do it. But worse, it made me hate writing. Copywriting was very formulaic and at times, it even felt scummy - I was basically trying to get people to do something that I often did not even believe in. 

Now, I am facing a similar problem. I study English at a uni, and the writing there is again poisoning me. Not only is it formulaic, but it feels.. gimmicky. Like I have to use complex sentences, cite everything I can for the fear of plagiarism, and basically ACT like I know my sh1t instead of actually KNOWING my sh1t. In my journal, I called it a creative prison - they want a soulless format, not a masterpiece. 

The funny thing is, I am damn good at it. My essays were mindblowing according to my professors, and during classes where students switch their essays, I could clearly tell that others were very subpar compared to me. But the amount of spite and tears that had gone into these essays...

However, I feel like I’ve reached the point of total information overload, and with so many options (often conflicting ones) presented out there, it’s hard to even know where to begin. 

I like the idea, and certainly see the merits, of taking a more outlined/preplanned approach to story as it let’s you brainstorm stuff without wasting a bunch of effort/time writing yourself into a dead end. However, I find it next to impossible to get into any sort of inspired/creative state when working this way. Inevitably (speaking for myself) things come out feeling thrown together to adapt to a reverse engineered framework that has proven successful before. I get disheartened/uninterested and abandon the project before it gets off the ground. 

The flip side is the people who advocate writing with no plan at all. Just take some spark of an idea and run with it, acting as a sort of stenographer for the characters telling you the story. I’ve even come across multiple people who write this way, who claim they do it in one draft, sort of cycling through and editing as they go. I’ll admit that this method gets me writing, but again inevitably around 30k words in I take a step back and wonder why I’ve been wasting my time on such a mess. So it sort of just delays the same outcome. I suppose at least in this approach, I actually get some practice writing prose which must count for something vs. practicing outlining, but still, unfinished and abandoned is unfinished and abandoned. 

You get people saying don’t worry about structure, “trust your instincts as a reader”. You get just as many people saying story needs structure and you must learn to work with it. Some say write fast edit later, others write slow and edit as they go. 


I guess the point is, with so many strong opinions out there I feel stifled to even continue a project to the point of completion. To be a writer is to sit down and write and see what works I suppose, and that’s not always so easy. Different people have different processes that work for them, and everyone has their own journey finding out ehat makes them tick. 

Guess I’m not looking for an answer here, as I will have to figure my own way through the noise. What would be interesting is to open a discussion here where those who have found their process, can share their journey in getting to that point. It would certainly be inspiring to a beginner who is feeling overwhelmed at the early stages in this journey!

writing,Lisa Cron’s Story Genius confuses me,"This is about my second time rereading Lisa Cron’s story genius and I can’t tell if I’m not properly grasping what she’s saying or if she’s contradics herself/ is hard to understand. 

For example on chapter 5 we read heavily about your protagonists misbelif, what they desire and the fear or “misbelif”  stopping them from getting what they desire. Lisa uses a real world example and i understand what she means by that “formula.” Then she gets to her friends example and from what I can read her friend isn’t following that formula Lisa claimed was super important a few paragraphs back. Lisa’s reasoning as to why her friends description works doesn’t make any sense to me either which confuses me even more anyone read this book and if so am I just not getting it or are you having the same problem?

writing,Novel Overview & Chapter Planning - Tips? Templates?,"I finished Act 1 of my first fantasy novel yesterday (yay!) but Acts 2 and 3 are daunting... mostly because I haven't planned them out too well.  I know the direction they need to head, and have my 3-Act structure, but I don't know the nitty gritty specifics. 

What do you find helps most in the plotting and planning stages?  Templates you use, etc?  I struggle with focus and motivation and have never found a tried and true method that works every time.  I use spreadsheets and Trello boards and have recently been digging into OneNote, but still feel faced with the overwhelming question of ""but how do I map this out??"" I'm thinking a short chapter by chapter overview, which I can then move to my Trello board.  And before anyone suggests that it's just a draft and to write whatever comes -- I've done this before as well and it hasn't ended, well with huge plot holes to fix later.

Just don't want yesterday's success to be the start of another round of months long writer's block  😅 I've been doing so well and this morning I got as far as writing down the few key points I knew I had to include.  I have unknown realms and species I still need to think about and plan for, so more worldbuilding and stuff required as well.

writing,Fan fic writer struggles to write original work,"I wonder if anyone else struggles with the same issue. I write fanfic, and most of my stories are heavily AU and don’t rely on the plot of the original work. I love it. I enjoy writing, and I can be quite prolific. Sometimes, I don’t know what to write first.

But when I want to write a completely original story, it’s like trying to bleed a stone. I get a lot of ideas for really cool or impactful scenes but nothing coherent, and whenever I try expanding on an idea, I always run into a wall.

writing,In-Story Time vs Actual Reading Time,"**TL;DR Do you feel like in-story time progressing feels more or less impactful than the length of actual reading time?**

  
Example: I have a short story idea where I'd like to have one character forgive another for a serious crime. To make it believable I have to give them time. We're talking years and decades, because forgiveness doesn't just come at the drop of a hat.

One way to make this ""time"" happen is to have more story beats. Things happens, more chapters, more pages, and the reader spends more *literal* time with the characters, and watches one character slowly forgive the other. There's a downside to this though. There has to be enough story to tell in between, and of course we end up with a much longer story.

A faster way would be to progress the in-story time. Maybe there's a few pages that describe years passings. Now there's a temporal distance, and then maybe a few major plot beats that lead to the forgiveness.

I know that a lot of this comes down to implementation, but do you feel that one is more effective than the other? Is method 2 always going to be jarring, or can that be done well too?

writing,Sex scenes done right?,"Bashing my head against the wall here editing a sex scene in my story. The sex scene comes as a reprieve after heavy drama but right before a tragic reveal. I’m trying to avoid it reading as too explicit while also trying to avoid the whole overly metaphorical “waves crashing on the shore.” I have no problems reading or writing smut but I find the majority of the ones I’ve read to be highly cringe inducing. The relationship in my story is a dark, twisted one while at this point both characters are sympathetic to the reader, the relationship is tainted by deception. Right now the sex scene mainly focuses on the emotions of the FMC, has some lyrical metaphors, and fades to black. It’s a bit too “waves on the shore” to me right now. The rest of my novel has of sexual content but is pretty restrained in terms of explicitness. 

It’s an adult dark love story and not a traditional romance but I anticipate most of the readership will probably be dark romance readers. My concern is that this readership may expect things that read like “he came and it made the mountains tremble” or “he X’ed my breasts, then he Y’ed my breasts, and my nipples Z’ed.” My frustration comes in how to still titillate the romance readers while avoiding alienating the non-romance readers. Maybe I’m overthinking things but I want to do the scene justice. What are examples of sex scenes done well that strike this balance?

writing,Advice for categorization,"I'm in the process of writing a novel, and I'm thinking ahead to the querying process. However I'm beginning to forsee a problem: my book is a ""coming of age -esque"" type, however it's somewhat of a story using conventions out of multiple genres including crime thriller and adventure. Therefore there are some more heavy themes and graphic scenes that might not be suitable for the younger end of the YA spectrum, which I believe is pretty much a must for the sub-genre.

I've thought about the up and coming New Adult categorization but I think at the moment it's just perhaps too niche to place an already niche combination of genres in.

So really I'm just looking for some advice. Is it just unmarketable and I need to go through and adapt to tick some more conventional boxes, or is there a way to have this fit into any certain description?

writing,Writers block led to a Realization.,"So I hit a wall in my writing again.^1 

And it’s not like I don’t have the ideas. I’m constantly working on the stories in my head, writing my notes. Noting lines, character backgrounds or plot points. 

But every time I sit down to type out the story between the bullet points…. I just ***tap tap tap*** the same key. All my ideas vanish or sit back as I hyper focus on the layout or the title page or 1 of the other 1000 things I feel the need to finish first. 

Leading me to today. 

I was passively planning a trip to the museum, to see if it would help unlock something. Inspire me or just give me something fun to do. 

As I always do, I started daydreaming about what the day will look like, what I’ll be seeing, what conversations I’ll be having. 

Here is where I had a realization. 

I was playing out a scenario where someone asks me about a painting. 

> -  “What emotion do you think the artist was trying to convey”

> - Me - “Does it really matter? It’s no longer the artists painting. Now that’s it’s open for public consumption. What we feel while looking at it or what we see in the painting is all that matters now.”

This made me pause. And run that back. lol

Once I finish my book, it’s no longer ***my*** book. It’s ours. It’s someone else’s favorite, someone else’s most hated, someone else’s random gift from an out of touch aunt. 

It’s not that I fear judgement. I actually like critique. To me it means an opportunity to be better or to double down on my way of writing. 

I do fear the intention being changed. Once it’s shared it can’t be unshared. It will no longer matter what my intentions were when l writing. The overarching message won’t matter. How the public perceives it, will be all that matters. What messages they get from the work will take precedent. How they view the characters will be more important. And so on and so forth. 


And that… is scary. Kind of feels like I’ll be losing something in a way. 

But I guess I’ll also be gaining something new. Perhaps they will see something beyond the writing and it’ll make the next book better or influence a new way a thinking for me. Who knows? Lol

writing,"Is there a name for this sort of writing? Tarantino, Kojima and Araki","I might be totally off on this subject, and this may also be the wrong subreddit to ask, but I might still get a good answer. 

I've noticed a few commonalities in the works of Quentin Tarantino, Hirohiko Araki and Hideo Kojima writing Movies, Manga and Games respectively. Their stories usually take themselves extremely seriously, to the point of almost being comedic although the story itself will never acknowledge this. They also all use a ton of references in their works, either in tropes they use, settings they reference or just adopting names. Again, all of these things will also almost never be acknowledged by the story.

My question is: is there a word for this sort of writing and can you think of other examples of it?

The best way I can describe it is as the opposite of lampshading, where the author will purposefully have something be a meta-element, but not draw any attention at all to it. ",9,5,2025-04-05 01:04:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/1jrpbx0/is_there_a_name_for_this_sort_of_writing/

I write now less about my love or desire to do so, but from an inherent need to prove my own ability. Now, whatever I do manage to put out is significantly worse than anything I had made before. It's unintelligible, pretentious, verbose, and painfully cyclical. Sentences don't make sense, both gramatically and comprehensively, and I've grown to feel extremely ashamed and demoralized from this whole process. I'm frusturated that I can't foster that same love for writing that had allowed me to write so carelessly before, and I feel forced to shamble in feelings of inadequacy as I produce work that is very much inadequate.

Not sure if I’m asking for advice or just ranting but yeah. I’ve hit that point where I always do in my stories and now I’m nervous lol. ",1,13,2025-04-05 05:31:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/1jrudgh/ive_hit_that_point/

writing,Is it okay for me to write about her?,"So I want to write a historical fantasy story about a pirate named Ching Shih (Zheng Yi Sao).

The problem is that she was a Chinese pirate and I am not Chinese.

Of course I am not going to write about her exactly. I will change some details and things like that, mainly to add fantasy elements.



But I don't know if I can write about her because I don't want to be really insensitive, even though the story doesn't really focus on the fact that she is Chinese, but that is who she is and I don't want to be insensitive.



What do you think?

(2 words, 6 marks)
- Gus’ “don’t panic!?”

I have been working on a fantasy series for some time. A personal project on the side. I have thousand page documents on world, culture and events as well as some mostly complete stories and drafts.

My question is where do I go from here I'm in a place where I want to share some of my work even if it's just bits. But I don't know where to share or what to share. 

Any advice?",1,4,2025-04-05 02:54:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/1jrrj53/advice/
writing,New writer asking for advice,"Hello! I am a new writer, nice to meet you!

I started writing recently (like 1 to 2 months ago), when I started taking a creative writing class. I've been having fun creating short stories, and I've already discovered an idea that I want to expand into a book/novella. It's besides the point, but I'm about 17,000 words in.

Anyway, as a new writer, I wanted to ask for general advice. My main interest in posting this is to understand the publishing process better, but I'd be interested in any advice that anyone can offer up. I figured asking people here could be a good step in my research, before I actually try to research with Google.

Specific publishing questions I have:

1. I've heard you should get an agent to talk to publishing companies, and you will basically never get any response from publishers if you don't use an agent. Is this true?
2. How do you protect your writing from getting stolen while sending your writing places?
3. Are certain book types considered more publishable than others? Like are novels generally published more than novellas? Are short story collections almost never published? What's the hierarchy, if there is any?

Thanks to anyone who comments. Again, I appreciate all advice.

Oh, I also wanted to know if there are any well-known writing forums where you can post stories and stuff. I know there's the weekly feedback thread here, but I think getting opinions from a wide range of people would be best, right?

Edit: To clear things up, I want to know about publishing because I want to know about it. Getting published is an ultimate goal that I will strive towards. I write for fun sometimes, but if I don't have a goal to strive for, I will almost definitely drop the hobby out of frustration that I am essentially only writing for myself. I have been interested in music as a hobby for a while now, and guess what? My interest in it isn't to make things that are only heard by me. I want to get my stuff out there. I'm hungry to get better, and my way of honing my craft isn't to sit by myself writing for myself for years before showing it to anyone. It's to show everyone my stuff, get feedback, and then try the feedback and decide if I like the new changes or not.",0,20,2025-04-05 02:23:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/1jrqxr9/new_writer_asking_for_advice/
