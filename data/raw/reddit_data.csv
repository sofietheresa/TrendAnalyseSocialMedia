"{""detail"":""Datei nicht gefunden""}all",Do Republicans Realize It’s Not Just Democrats - The Whole World Looks at Them with Disgust,"Republicans keep acting like this is just a culture war, as if it's about DEI, immigrants, or whatever grievance of the week gets them riled up. But what they’re enabling under Trump isn’t a debate. It’s a global threat, and the rest of the world sees it clearly.

Trump has insulted allies, threatened to abandon NATO, and pulled the U.S. out of the Paris Climate Accord again. He has imposed tariffs on Canada and Germany out of spite, joked about annexing Canada, and treated diplomacy like a reality show. These are not policies. They are provocations, and they are shaking the global order.

Now he has pulled back support for Ukraine, unraveling years of unity and leaving Europe to question whether the U.S. can still be trusted.

Republicans have already made clear they don't care how this affects people here. But they seem equally indifferent to the fact that it's dragging the rest of the world down with them. Their loyalty to Trump is wrecking alliances, stalling climate action, emboldening dictators, and unraveling decades of shared progress.

To much of the world, it looks like insanity - a country sabotaging the very systems it built, while millions cheer it on like a sport. This isn’t just short-sighted. It's a betrayal of everything we once stood for, both at home and abroad. The world is not confused. They're disgusted. And they’re right to be.


Edit:

I just realized every so-called right-wing reply in this sub comes from a negative karma troll account. Seriously check accounts - negative 60, negative 100, every time. Are you guys bots, trolls, or just Republicans who can’t post from a real profile? You need a burner just to spread MAGA filth? This is crazy.

all,AITAH for refusing to pay my friend for a custom cake because it included something I’m allergic to?,"My (28F) friend (30F) is a self-taught baker who recently started her own small business. She’s made some great cakes in the past, and I wanted to support her, so I asked if she could make a cake for my mom’s 60th birthday. I told her I wanted something floral and elegant, and I gave her some examples. I also told her clearly that my mom is allergic to almonds like, epi-pen level allergic.

She agreed, and I paid her a $100 deposit for the $250 cake. A week later, I went to pick it up and she was so proud of it. It looked beautiful, honestly, but when I asked what flavor it was, she told me it was almond vanilla, because she thought it gave it a “more upscale taste.”

I was shocked. I reminded her my mom is allergic to almonds, and she just kind of brushed it off and said it was such a small amount and it would be fine as long as my mom didn’t eat too much. I told her I couldn’t take the cake, and she got upset, saying I was being overdramatic and ungrateful for all her hard work.

I told her she could either make a new cake or I wouldn’t be paying the rest. She refused, and now mutual friends are telling me I should’ve just accepted it and gotten a different dessert for my mom. Others say I was right not to risk it.

I didn’t mean to cause drama, but I’m honestly hurt that she ignored something so serious.

,,,,,,,,all,She erased us from her wedding. So I’m erasing her from mine.,"When my brother got married, his bride (now my sister-in-law) had very specific expectations. She wanted everyone in the family to wear their wedding colors, and we all did. People flew in from out of state. Everyone made an effort to make her feel celebrated.

The day before the wedding, she made some offhanded (but clearly pointed) remarks about how “our side” of the family never takes anything seriously and she wasn’t expecting us to take this seriously either. The comments made their rounds, and feelings were hurt before the wedding even began. But we still showed up, looked great, and participated.

Fast forward to getting the wedding photos and video: not a single photo of our side of the family was posted. Not one. In the entire 3-minute highlight reel? No faces from our family, except a 3-second clip of my parents with the bride and groom. The rest of us? It’s like we never existed.

I texted her (cordially) and asked if she could send me the pictures with just our siblings, since none had been posted. She responded that we never took those pictures. That’s wild because I remember helping people adjust corsages for them. She doubled down on the gaslighting. I gave it six months and asked again—she suddenly had no idea what I was talking about.

Fine.

Here’s where the petty revenge comes in.

I’m getting married in 8 days. I’ve been engaged for 6 months and planning this moment since she tried to erase us. I hired a great photographer and videographer. What she doesn’t know is that the videographer has a secret mission: make it look like she’s getting all the attention. Track her. Hover near her like she’s the star of the show. She will feel so seen.

And then… the final cut?

She won’t appear for even one second. Just like she made sure we didn’t.

I didn’t even invite her originally. Word must’ve gotten out because she cornered me at a family dinner and said, “Unfortunately I have to work the day before and after your wedding, but I should still be able to make it.” I was so stunned I just said, “That’s fine. The Airbnb is booked whether you’re there or not.” So now she’s coming. Ugh.

To cope? I spelled her name wrong on the wedding invite on purpose. That was my first move. The video blackout will be my last.

Not asking for advice. Not asking if it’s “too mean.” It’s not. It’s exactly fair.

Happy to finally talk about it freely 😌",4545.0,1044.0,2025-05-03 05:19:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1kdlelx/she_erased_us_from_her_wedding_so_im_erasing_her/,2025-05-03 08:58:16.134905
,,,,,,,,all,"UPDATE: AITAH for telling my MIL to stop calling herself ""Mom"" to my baby?","I just want to give you an update about by situation

Original Post

I was so happy when I gave birth to my daughter four months ago. Shes my first child and honestly it's been a rollercoaster ride for me. My husband has been great but the problem started with his mom. From day one my MIL has been very involved. She visited the hospital the day after I gave birth and was constantly hovering offering advice I didn’t ask for. I chalked it up to excitement. But then things started getting weird. She began referring to herself as Mommy when holding my daughter. At first I thought I misheard. But she kept doing it. When I gently corrected her she laughed it off like I was being silly. I told my husband it made me uncomfortable and he agreed it was odd but didn’t want to confront her because according to him “that’s just how she is.""

So I did. The next time she said it, I calmly said to her that, Please don’t call yourself Mom around my daughter. It’s confusing, and frankly, it’s not your role. She looked shocked then told me I was overreacting and that babies don’t understand titles at this age. I stood firm and said, Maybe not now, but she will soon. And I’m her mom. You’re her grandma. That should be a special title too. She got upset and left early. Later that day, I got a long text about how I embarrassed her, how she was just expressing lov and how I’m being territorial and insecure. Now some of my in-laws are saying I hurt her feelings and should apologize because it’s not like she’s trying to replace me. I don’t think I’m being insecure  I just want clear. My baby will only have one mom.

So… AITAH for telling my MIL to stop calling herself “Mom” to my baby?

  
Update:

Thanks to everyone who commented  reading your responses really helped me feel more grounded. I wanted to give an update because things definitely escalated, but in some unexpected ways. So, after the confrontation and her dramatic exit, my MIL went full hurt grandma mode. She told extended family I banned her from seeing the baby (which I didn’t and that I accused her of trying to kidnap her granddaughter (???). The group texts got wild. A few flying monkeys started chiming in about how I need help and how babies don’t care what you call yourself anyway. I didn’t respond to any of it. My husband finally stepped up and called her directly. He told her she needed to respect boundaries or there would be consequences. She cried (again), said she was just trying to love the baby the way she knew how and that I was turning him against her. She posted a photo of her holding our daughter on Facebook with the caption, Mommy’s girl. Publicly. Tagging family. That was my breaking point. I immediately texted her and said, Until you can respect the fact that I am her mother  not you  we are going to take a break from visits. My husband backed me up 100%. We’ve since limited contact to just polite texts and occasional check-ins and no in-person visits for now. She hasn't apologized. So far, life has been a lot more peaceful. I’ve gotten some icy texts from a couple family members, but more surprisingly a few others reached out privately to say they had similar issues with her and respected how I handled it.

,,,,,,,,all,TIFU by trying to flirt with a guy at the gym and ending up in a full-blown CPR situation😭,"So this happened yesterday and I’m still cringing so hard I might never step into that gym again.

I (22F) recently started going to this new gym, and there’s this insanely cute guy who works out around the same time as me. I’ve been trying to find the courage to talk to him for a couple of weeks. Yesterday, I finally decided it was time.

I saw him doing deadlifts and I thought, “okay, casual compliment, easy in.” So I walked by, smiled, and said, “Your lats are majestic.” Wtf? Majestic?? What was i thinking(???) 😭😭😭
Idk why I said that. I meant to say “You’re lifting a lot” or “Nice form” or literally anything else.

He looked confused, said “uh… thanks?” and I panicked and decided to just walk away and die in the locker room.
While trying to speed-walk away in embarrassment, I tripped over a medicine ball someone left in the way, my face-planted into the floor, and I knocked the wind out of myself so hard I couldn’t breathe for like 20 seconds.
A trainer saw it happen, thought I was having a heart attack, and started actual CPR protocol before I could wheeze out “I’m fine.”

That same cute guy helped hold my legs up while I got oxygen. Pretty sure I died inside.
Anyway, now I’m the “CPR girl” at the gym. And yes, I still plan to go back (I cannot😭).

TL;DR: Tried to flirt with hot guy at the gym, said something incomprehensible, tripped, and ended up getting nearly resuscitated in front of him.😭🙏🏻

,,,,,,,,popular,AITAH for refusing to chip in for a coworker's wedding gift after literally being uninvited?,"Alright AITAH ppl, imma need your hot takes on this office drama that's been driving me insane  
  
So I (27F) have been working at this marketing agency for about 2 years. My coworker Jess (31F) is getting married next month and initially invited our whole team (8 people) to her wedding. We're not like besties besties, but definitely friendly - lunch together sometimes, happy hours, the usual work friend stuff.  
  
Last week our office manager Sarah started collecting money for a group gift. She's asking for $200 each which would get us some fancy kitchen gadget from their registry. That's basically what I'd budget for someone I'm actually friends with, but whatever, I was planning to contribute.  
  
WELL. Yesterday I got the most awkward text from Jess saying they ""had to make some cuts to the guest list"" and unfortunately they couldn't accommodate me anymore. Something about venue capacity and family additions. But here's the kicker - I KNOW FOR A FACT that everyone else on our team is still invited!!! 🙃  
  
This morning Sarah comes by my desk asking for my contribution to the gift fund. I politely told her that since I'm no longer invited, I'd rather get Jess a smaller gift on my own. Sarah looked shocked and said ""but it's a team gift"" and that not contributing the full amount would ""mess up the group harmony"" (like I give a single fuck)  
  
The icing on the cake? I know the wedding cut was because Jess invited her old coworker who just got a VP position at a major client. Suddenly there's ""no room"" for me, but I'm still expected to drop $200 on her registry?  
  
Can someone please tell me the truth if I'm the asshole for refusing to contribute the full amount to a wedding I'm not even attending?",11933.0,1532.0,2025-05-02 15:49:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1kd4bec/aitah_for_refusing_to_chip_in_for_a_coworkers/,2025-05-03 08:58:16.134905

,,,,,,,,trendingreddits,How To Guide | The Smart Blogger’s Path to a Steady Online Income,"Blogging isn’t dead—it’s evolved. What once began as an online journal has grown into a powerful tool for building authority, growing an audience, and generating sustainable income. Whether you’re a solopreneur, side hustler, or small business owner, blogging is still one of the smartest ways to earn online. But success doesn’t come overnight—it takes strategy, consistency, and knowing what works today.

In this guide, we’ll break down the path smart bloggers take to turn their writing into a steady source of income—and how you can do the same.

Why Blogging Still Works in 2025
Despite the explosion of video content and social media, blogging continues to thrive. Why? Because search engines still prioritize quality written content. People turn to Google every day with questions, and blogs that offer valuable answers continue to rise to the top.

According to a HubSpot study, businesses that blog get 55% more website visitors than those that don’t. This is especially important for American entrepreneurs looking to build authority in competitive niches.

Real-World Example: NerdWallet
NerdWallet, a personal finance company, built its multi-million-dollar brand primarily through blogging. By publishing SEO-optimized content that answered common money questions, it attracted millions of readers—and converted them into users of its affiliate partners and services.

,,,,,,,,trendingreddits,How to Prepare Americans for Upcoming Job Loss Due to AI,"As artificial intelligence (AI) continues to evolve, it’s becoming increasingly clear that its impact on the workforce will be profound. While AI promises greater efficiency, lower costs, and new industries, it also poses a significant threat to many traditional jobs—especially those involving repetitive, rule-based tasks. For Americans, the challenge ahead isn’t just technological—it’s personal, economic, and cultural.


What Jobs Are Most at Risk?
Let’s be honest — it’s the working class that’s getting hit first.
Not all jobs are equally vulnerable to AI automation. Roles that involve routine, repetitive tasks are the most at risk. So how can workers prepare for the AI-driven transformation of the labor market? Here’s a look at what’s coming, and what can be done about it. These include:

Administrative support (data entry, payroll, scheduling)

Transportation (drivers, delivery)

Retail and customer service

Basic manufacturing and warehouse jobs

Even white-collar jobs in finance, legal services, and journalism are starting to see AI encroach on tasks like report writing, contract analysis, and data interpretation.

Porcupine Tree is unquestionably one of the most difficult-to-categorize and innovative rock bands of all time. The band was formed by musician Steven Wilson in 1987, and began essentially as a solo project for Wilson, who created all of the music. By December 1993, Wilson desired to work in a band environment, and so brought on frequent collaborators. The band has been on hiatus since 2010.

Welcome to the subreddit of the poet laureate of rock 'n' roll.

The voice of the promise of the '60s counter-culture. The guy who forced folk into bed with rock. Who donned make-up in the '70s and disappeared into a haze of substance abuse. Who emerged to find Jesus. Who was written off as a has-been by the end of the '80s and who suddenly shifted gears, releasing some of the strongest music of his career beginning in the late '90s.

Ladies and gentlemen — Columbia recording artist Bob Dylan!

,,,,,,,,all,Neighbor kept stealing our Amazon packages. So I mailed him something special.,"We kept losing packages. Security cams caught the culprit—our neighbor. Bold as ever, he’d walk right up and take boxes off our porch.

So I ordered a “special” delivery: a glitter bomb inside a fake package, timed for when he’d usually steal it. Sure enough, it vanished within hours.

Thirty minutes later, I heard yelling. Glitter everywhere. He hasn’t touched a single box since. Our packages? Arriving safely now.

,,,,,,,,all,I traveled solo to Japan to 'find myself' and ended up having this quiet moment in Kyoto that I can’t stop thinking about,"Hey everyone,  
I’ve been lurking here for a while and figured I’d finally share something from a recent trip. I just got back from three weeks in Japan, my first time traveling alone. I’m 26, recently single, and was feeling kind of stuck in life. Quit a job I hated, felt burnt out, and booked this trip hoping it would reset something in my brain.

And honestly, it did. But not in the way I expected.

Japan was incredible. I started in Tokyo, and the first night I just sat in a Lawson eating onigiri and felt like I was on another planet. It was loud and beautiful and confusing and amazing all at once. I kind of stumbled my way through the first week, but once I got used to it, I felt so free in a way I hadn’t in years.

The moment I want to share happened in Kyoto. I was trying to find this temple, Kiyomizu-dera, but my phone was on 4% and the directions were useless. I must’ve looked super lost because this older woman walking a little white dog stopped and said something to me in Japanese. I just pointed at the temple on my map and kinda shrugged.

She smiled and motioned for me to follow her. I thought she’d just point me in the right direction, but she actually walked with me the whole way. Like, 15 or 20 minutes through these quiet little side streets. We didn’t speak the same language, but it wasn’t awkward. She pointed out a few little things along the way like flowers or shrines and smiled every time I looked confused or amazed.

Her dog kept checking behind to make sure I was still there, which was somehow the cutest thing I’ve ever experienced.

When we got to the temple, I bowed and said thank you like five times. She just smiled, said something softly, and then turned around and walked back the way we came. Like it was nothing. Just helped a lost tourist without a second thought.

I don’t know. That moment has stayed with me more than any big tourist attraction. It was so simple, but so kind. I felt really seen in that moment, which was weird because we barely spoke.

Travel gives you these weird little memories that hit harder than you expect. I still think about her and her dog and that peaceful walk through Kyoto like it was a dream.

Have any of you had an experience like that? Where a stranger completely changed your day without even realizing it?",1568.0,120.0,2025-05-03 10:16:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1kdpo8b/i_traveled_solo_to_japan_to_find_myself_and_ended/,2025-05-03 11:43:36.606207
,,,,,,,,all,Update: AITAH for considering calling off my wedding because my fiancée refuses to sign a prenup after I found out she has a massive cedit card debt?,"it has been a tough few days for me after sharing my story here but I feel like I owe you guys an update about me situation so here it is

My first Post: I am just a middle aged man supposed to be getting married in a few months to my fiancée. We've been together for three years engaged for one and for most of that time I genuinely believed we were on the same page about life values and most importantly honesty. For background: I’ve worked hard to build a stable financial foundation. I’m not wealth, but I own my home outright, have no personal debt and I’ve been saving and investing since my early twenties. It’s been a priority for me especially since my parents went through a nasty divorce that ruined both of them financially. About a month ago, while we were discussing wedding costs, I brought up a prenup. Not in a cold or controlling way I just wanted to protect the life I’ve worked hard to build. I was upfront that I’d still be fair and the agreement wouldn’t leave her with nothing. I expected an adult conversation. Instead she immediately got defensive. She said things like So you’re already planning for a divorce? and I thought we trusted each other. I tried to explain it wasn’t about trust it was about transparency and mutual protection. But she shut it down completely. That’s when red flags started popping up. She became evasive every time money came up and I started noticing weird things credit card offers in the mail, a few missed payments on shared expenses she said she'd cover, and lots of I'll handle it later energy.

So, I asked directly if she had debt. She admitted it. $92,000 in credit card debt. Not student loans. Not a mortgage. Credit cards. She said it accumulated over the years from unexpected expenses and a few dumb splurges but she never told me about any of it until I forced the issue. I was stunned. We’re about to merge lives. This woman was about to legally become my spouse and she didn’t think I deserved to know she was six figures in the red? I told her this made the prenup non-negotiable for me. I need to protect myself not just emotionally, but financially. I told her I was willing to still move forward but not without something in writing that protects my premarital assets. She lost it. Called me selfish. Said I was turning love into a business deal. Said my house and money should be hers too if we’re truly a team. Since then, she’s refused to talk about the prenup again and we’re barely speaking. Even her mother called me and accused me of humiliating her daughter and being materialistic. All I want is to not be liable for debt I didn’t create and to make sure the life I built before this relationship is protected. So now I’m seriously reconsidering the whole wedding. Not because she has debt but because she hid it then refused to take responsibility and now is treating me like the bad guy for trying to protect myself. I'm almost certain that she could pay her debts since she is a part partner in her friend's business but she just refuses to. AITAH for thinking about walking away?

My final update: so I wasn’t planning to come back, but a lot of people messaged me and honestly… it’s been a hell of a few days. Figured I’d give an update. So yeah… the wedding is officially off. After I posted I tried one more time to talk to my fiancée (well, ex now). I told her I wasn’t trying to be cold or controlling I just needed to protect myself. I also said that if the roles were reversed, I’d completely understand if she wanted to do the same. I told her I could still move forward with the wedding if we signed a fair prenup. One that clearly said her debt is hers and my home/savings are mine if things go bad. I also said I’d go to therapy or counseling with her if this felt like a deeper trust issue. She didn’t take it well. Said again that the prenup was an insult and I was basically planning for divorce. Then she started crying and said I was humiliating her and that I was destroying everything we had built over money. But that’s the thing it’s not just about the money. It’s about the fact that she kept a massive amount of debt hidden until she had no choice but to tell me. And even then, she only told me because I pushed for it. That’s not partnership, that’s avoidance. So I told her I couldn’t go through with it. I called off the wedding. It sucked. It still sucks. We told the venue canceled what we could and let people know. Her family is furious. Mine has been supportive but trying not to say I told you so. I’ve lost a lot of money deposits suit some family flying in from out of state but honestly, that’s nothing compared to what could’ve happened if I had ignored my gut.

She moved out two days ago. We’ve barely spoken. I keep second-guessing myself, even now. I didn’t want this. But I also don’t want to wake up one day in financial ruin wondering why I ignored every red flag just to avoid hurting someone. Anyway, thanks for everyone who gave advice or just listened. I’m heartbroken, yeah, but I feel like I did the right thing. Doesn’t make it easy.

,,,,,,,,popular,AITAH for refusing to chip in for a coworker's wedding gift after literally being uninvited?,"Alright AITAH ppl, imma need your hot takes on this office drama that's been driving me insane

So I (27F) have been working at this marketing agency for about 2 years. My coworker Jess (31F) is getting married next month and initially invited our whole team (8 people) to her wedding. We're not like besties besties, but definitely friendly - lunch together sometimes, happy hours, the usual work friend stuff.

Last week our office manager Sarah started collecting money for a group gift. She's asking for $200 each which would get us some fancy kitchen gadget from their registry. That's basically what I'd budget for someone I'm actually friends with, but whatever, I was planning to contribute.

WELL. Yesterday I got the most awkward text from Jess saying they ""had to make some cuts to the guest list"" and unfortunately they couldn't accommodate me anymore. Something about venue capacity and family additions. But here's the kicker - I KNOW FOR A FACT that everyone else on our team is still invited!!! 🙃

This morning Sarah comes by my desk asking for my contribution to the gift fund. I politely told her that since I'm no longer invited, I'd rather get Jess a smaller gift on my own. Sarah looked shocked and said ""but it's a team gift"" and that not contributing the full amount would ""mess up the group harmony"" (like I give a single fuck)

The icing on the cake? I know the wedding cut was because Jess invited her old coworker who just got a VP position at a major client. Suddenly there's ""no room"" for me, but I'm still expected to drop $200 on her registry? The thing is that (I'm not trying to brag whatsoever), but I literally hit a 5k win on Jackpotcity like last weekend so that $200 isn't even a big deal, but what she did to me specifically is something I ain't gonna tolerate

Can someone please tell me the truth if I'm the asshole for refusing to contribute the full amount to a wedding I'm not even attending?",12699.0,1599.0,2025-05-02 15:49:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1kd4bec/aitah_for_refusing_to_chip_in_for_a_coworkers/,2025-05-03 11:43:36.606207

So I ordered a “special” delivery: a glitter bomb inside a fake package, timed for when he’d usually steal it. Sure enough, it vanished within hours.

Thirty minutes later, I heard yelling. Glitter everywhere. He hasn’t touched a single box since. Our packages? Arriving safely now.

,,,,,,,,popular,TIFU by losing my fiance over crypto,"So, yeah, I totally screwed up big time. Me and my fiance, Jess, been together 4 years, engaged for 1. Everything was great, we was planning our wedding, picking venues and all that. But then I got sucked into crypto, specifically Solana. I thought I was gonna be some genius investor, you know?

It started when I saw some X posts about memecoins, that they are like super fast, cheap fees, blah blah. I’m not rich, but I had like 10k saved up for the wedding. I figured, why not throw 5k into those coins? Make a quick buck, surprise Jess with a fancier honeymoon. I didn’t tell her, cause I wanted it to be a surprise.

Big mistake. i lost everything in the first few weeks. My 10k was gone. I was freaking out, couldn’t sleep. Jess noticed I was acting weird, kept asking what’s wrong. I didn’t wanna tell her I blew our wedding fund, so I lied, said it was work stress.

She found out anyway. I left my laptop open, and she saw the trading app, the red numbers, the whole mess. She flipped out, screaming how I gambled our future without even telling her. I tried to explain, said I’d make it back. She wasn’t having it. Said I broke her trust, acted like some sneaky addict. She gave me back the ring, packed a bag, and left to her mom’s.

That was 2 weeks ago. She’s barely talking to me, says she needs space.

Though in some years, I will earn well though. And I barely get time for going to parlour etc. As I just want to rest on Sundays. Note I am very well maintained girl and like to keep myself groomed, stylish. My bf 28m is civil engineer.

He was at my place and we got cosy. I am not super hairy, but had some hair down there. After we had fun, he told me he got disgusted by hair down there and why  am i not mainting my hygiene? Note I keep myself super clean and before we got cosy. I took bath and applied lotions. I asked did he smell something? He said those hair looks bad and he likes me smooth.

I got irritated and said his nose hair need to be trimmed,  because they look so big and I felt disgusted to kiss him, when they touched my lips. I told him he hasn't trimmed his chest hair in whole. They are touching his neck .

He got offended and isn't talking to me. But I won't apologise. He said i didn't smell bad. Then i told him he is super hairy and he should be mature enough to understand that I am not a p**n star to be hairless all the time.  Did i take it too far? Though this morning he has trimmed it all lmao. 

Though I like chest hair when they are not coming out of your shirt buttons.

Edit. People do your research. Having pubes doesn't equate to bring unhygienic. You have to keep it clean and you are well to go. And atleast I don't have back hair as well as countless hair all over the body. But I never shamed him for them

Edit two. I am not going to breakup over this unless it becomes pattern. We will have discussion..we have done many good things for each other over the last three years. 

Edit three. Please stop telling me to breakup. I am here for yta or nta or esh. Also he didn't call me disgusting. He said he find pubes disgusting. There is lots of difference. 

We will have discussion like adults soon. I don't see this road bump as reason to breakup. If he isn't willing to change his attitude, I will though. I am not a pushover.

Trump has insulted allies, threatened to abandon NATO, and pulled the U.S. out of the Paris Climate Accord again. He has imposed tariffs on Canada and Germany out of spite, joked about annexing Canada, and treated diplomacy like a reality show. These are not policies. They are provocations, and they are shaking the global order.

Now he has pulled back support for Ukraine, unraveling years of unity and leaving Europe to question whether the U.S. can still be trusted.

Republicans have already made clear they don't care how this affects people here. But they seem equally indifferent to the fact that it's dragging the rest of the world down with them. Their loyalty to Trump is wrecking alliances, stalling climate action, emboldening dictators, and unraveling decades of shared progress.

To much of the world, it looks like insanity - a country sabotaging the very systems it built, while millions cheer it on like a sport. This isn’t just short-sighted. It's a betrayal of everything we once stood for, both at home and abroad. The world is not confused. They're disgusted. And they’re right to be.

I just realized every so-called right-wing reply in this sub comes from a negative karma troll account. Seriously check accounts - negative 60, negative 100, every time.

all,AITAH for refusing to pay my friend for a custom cake because it included something I’m allergic to?,"My (28F) friend (30F) is a self-taught baker who recently started her own small business. She’s made some great cakes in the past, and I wanted to support her, so I asked if she could make a cake for my mom’s 60th birthday. I told her I wanted something floral and elegant, and I gave her some examples. I also told her clearly that my mom is allergic to almonds like, epi-pen level allergic.

She agreed, and I paid her a $100 deposit for the $250 cake. A week later, I went to pick it up and she was so proud of it. It looked beautiful, honestly, but when I asked what flavor it was, she told me it was almond vanilla, because she thought it gave it a “more upscale taste.”

I was shocked. I reminded her my mom is allergic to almonds, and she just kind of brushed it off and said it was such a small amount and it would be fine as long as my mom didn’t eat too much. I told her I couldn’t take the cake, and she got upset, saying I was being overdramatic and ungrateful for all her hard work.

I told her she could either make a new cake or I wouldn’t be paying the rest. She refused, and now mutual friends are telling me I should’ve just accepted it and gotten a different dessert for my mom. Others say I was right not to risk it.

I didn’t mean to cause drama, but I’m honestly hurt that she ignored something so serious.

,,,,,,,,all,She erased us from her wedding. So I’m erasing her from mine.,"When my brother got married, his bride (now my sister-in-law) had very specific expectations. She wanted everyone in the family to wear their wedding colors, and we all did. People flew in from out of state. Everyone made an effort to make her feel celebrated.

The day before the wedding, she made some offhanded (but clearly pointed) remarks about how “our side” of the family never takes anything seriously and she wasn’t expecting us to take this seriously either. The comments made their rounds, and feelings were hurt before the wedding even began. But we still showed up, looked great, and participated.

Fast forward to getting the wedding photos and video: not a single photo of our side of the family was posted. Not one. In the entire 3-minute highlight reel? No faces from our family, except a 3-second clip of my parents with the bride and groom. The rest of us? It’s like we never existed.

I texted her (cordially) and asked if she could send me the pictures with just our siblings, since none had been posted. She responded that we never took those pictures. That’s wild because I remember helping people adjust corsages for them. She doubled down on the gaslighting. I gave it six months and asked again—she suddenly had no idea what I was talking about.

Fine.

Here’s where the petty revenge comes in.

I’m getting married in 8 days. I’ve been engaged for 6 months and planning this moment since she tried to erase us. I hired a great photographer and videographer. What she doesn’t know is that the videographer has a secret mission: make it look like she’s getting all the attention. Track her. Hover near her like she’s the star of the show. She will feel so seen.

And then… the final cut?

She won’t appear for even one second. Just like she made sure we didn’t.

I didn’t even invite her originally. Word must’ve gotten out because she cornered me at a family dinner and said, “Unfortunately I have to work the day before and after your wedding, but I should still be able to make it.” I was so stunned I just said, “That’s fine. The Airbnb is booked whether you’re there or not.” So now she’s coming. Ugh.

To cope? I spelled her name wrong on the wedding invite on purpose. That was my first move. The video blackout will be my last.

Not asking for advice. Not asking if it’s “too mean.” It’s not. It’s exactly fair.

,,,,,,,,all,"UPDATE: AITAH for telling my MIL to stop calling herself ""Mom"" to my baby?","I just want to give you an update about by situation

Original Post

I was so happy when I gave birth to my daughter four months ago. Shes my first child and honestly it's been a rollercoaster ride for me. My husband has been great but the problem started with his mom. From day one my MIL has been very involved. She visited the hospital the day after I gave birth and was constantly hovering offering advice I didn’t ask for. I chalked it up to excitement. But then things started getting weird. She began referring to herself as Mommy when holding my daughter. At first I thought I misheard. But she kept doing it. When I gently corrected her she laughed it off like I was being silly. I told my husband it made me uncomfortable and he agreed it was odd but didn’t want to confront her because according to him “that’s just how she is.""

So I did. The next time she said it, I calmly said to her that, Please don’t call yourself Mom around my daughter. It’s confusing, and frankly, it’s not your role. She looked shocked then told me I was overreacting and that babies don’t understand titles at this age. I stood firm and said, Maybe not now, but she will soon. And I’m her mom. You’re her grandma. That should be a special title too. She got upset and left early. Later that day, I got a long text about how I embarrassed her, how she was just expressing lov and how I’m being territorial and insecure. Now some of my in-laws are saying I hurt her feelings and should apologize because it’s not like she’s trying to replace me. I don’t think I’m being insecure  I just want clear. My baby will only have one mom.

So… AITAH for telling my MIL to stop calling herself “Mom” to my baby?

  
Update:

Thanks to everyone who commented  reading your responses really helped me feel more grounded. I wanted to give an update because things definitely escalated, but in some unexpected ways. So, after the confrontation and her dramatic exit, my MIL went full hurt grandma mode. She told extended family I banned her from seeing the baby (which I didn’t and that I accused her of trying to kidnap her granddaughter (???). The group texts got wild. A few flying monkeys started chiming in about how I need help and how babies don’t care what you call yourself anyway. I didn’t respond to any of it. My husband finally stepped up and called her directly. He told her she needed to respect boundaries or there would be consequences. She cried (again), said she was just trying to love the baby the way she knew how and that I was turning him against her. She posted a photo of her holding our daughter on Facebook with the caption, Mommy’s girl. Publicly. Tagging family. That was my breaking point. I immediately texted her and said, Until you can respect the fact that I am her mother  not you  we are going to take a break from visits. My husband backed me up 100%. We’ve since limited contact to just polite texts and occasional check-ins and no in-person visits for now. She hasn't apologized. So far, life has been a lot more peaceful. I’ve gotten some icy texts from a couple family members, but more surprisingly a few others reached out privately to say they had similar issues with her and respected how I handled it.

I (22F) recently started going to this new gym, and there’s this insanely cute guy who works out around the same time as me. I’ve been trying to find the courage to talk to him for a couple of weeks. Yesterday, I finally decided it was time.

I saw him doing deadlifts and I thought, “okay, casual compliment, easy in.” So I walked by, smiled, and said, “Your lats are majestic.” Wtf? Majestic?? What was i thinking(???) 😭😭😭
Idk why I said that. I meant to say “You’re lifting a lot” or “Nice form” or literally anything else.

He looked confused, said “uh… thanks?” and I panicked and decided to just walk away and die in the locker room.
While trying to speed-walk away in embarrassment, I tripped over a medicine ball someone left in the way, my face-planted into the floor, and I knocked the wind out of myself so hard I couldn’t breathe for like 20 seconds.
A trainer saw it happen, thought I was having a heart attack, and started actual CPR protocol before I could wheeze out “I’m fine.”

That same cute guy helped hold my legs up while I got oxygen. Pretty sure I died inside.
Anyway, now I’m the “CPR girl” at the gym. And yes, I still plan to go back (I cannot😭).

TL;DR: Tried to flirt with hot guy at the gym, said something incomprehensible, tripped, and ended up getting nearly resuscitated in front of him.😭🙏🏻

,,,,,,,,popular,AITAH for refusing to chip in for a coworker's wedding gift after literally being uninvited?,"Alright AITAH ppl, imma need your hot takes on this office drama that's been driving me insane  
  
So I (27F) have been working at this marketing agency for about 2 years. My coworker Jess (31F) is getting married next month and initially invited our whole team (8 people) to her wedding. We're not like besties besties, but definitely friendly - lunch together sometimes, happy hours, the usual work friend stuff.  
  
Last week our office manager Sarah started collecting money for a group gift. She's asking for $200 each which would get us some fancy kitchen gadget from their registry. That's basically what I'd budget for someone I'm actually friends with, but whatever, I was planning to contribute.  
  
WELL. Yesterday I got the most awkward text from Jess saying they ""had to make some cuts to the guest list"" and unfortunately they couldn't accommodate me anymore. Something about venue capacity and family additions. But here's the kicker - I KNOW FOR A FACT that everyone else on our team is still invited!!! 🙃  
  
This morning Sarah comes by my desk asking for my contribution to the gift fund. I politely told her that since I'm no longer invited, I'd rather get Jess a smaller gift on my own. Sarah looked shocked and said ""but it's a team gift"" and that not contributing the full amount would ""mess up the group harmony"" (like I give a single fuck)  
  
The icing on the cake? I know the wedding cut was because Jess invited her old coworker who just got a VP position at a major client. Suddenly there's ""no room"" for me, but I'm still expected to drop $200 on her registry?  
  
Can someone please tell me the truth if I'm the asshole for refusing to contribute the full amount to a wedding I'm not even attending?",11933.0,1532.0,2025-05-02 15:49:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1kd4bec/aitah_for_refusing_to_chip_in_for_a_coworkers/,2025-05-03 08:58:16.134905

When we got back, I told him I was going to wash my face so I could take off my make up and get comfortable. He looked me in my face and said, shocked, ""you're wearing make up???"" I'm not kidding, eyebrows done, eyeliner, blush, contour, lashes, the whole 9 yards.

So men, please tell me what is going on. Is he trying to be cute or did he seriously not notice

What once began as an online journal has grown into a powerful tool for building authority, growing an audience, and generating sustainable income. Whether you’re a solopreneur, side hustler, or small business owner, blogging is still one of the smartest ways to earn online. But success doesn’t come overnight—it takes strategy, consistency, and knowing what works today.

In this guide, we’ll break down the path smart bloggers take to turn their writing into a steady source of income—and how you can do the same.

Why Blogging Still Works in 2025
Despite the explosion of video content and social media, blogging continues to thrive. Why? Because search engines still prioritize quality written content. People turn to Google every day with questions, and blogs that offer valuable answers continue to rise to the top.

According to a HubSpot study, businesses that blog get 55% more website visitors than those that don’t. This is especially important for American entrepreneurs looking to build authority in competitive niches.

Real-World Example: NerdWallet
NerdWallet, a personal finance company, built its multi-million-dollar brand primarily through blogging. By publishing SEO-optimized content that answered common money questions, it attracted millions of readers—and converted them into users of its affiliate partners and services.

,,,,,,,,trendingreddits,How to Prepare Americans for Upcoming Job Loss Due to AI,"As artificial intelligence (AI) continues to evolve, it’s becoming increasingly clear that its impact on the workforce will be profound. While AI promises greater efficiency, lower costs, and new industries, it also poses a significant threat to many traditional jobs—especially those involving repetitive, rule-based tasks. For Americans, the challenge ahead isn’t just technological—it’s personal, economic, and cultural.


What Jobs Are Most at Risk?
Let’s be honest — it’s the working class that’s getting hit first.
Not all jobs are equally vulnerable to AI automation. Roles that involve routine, repetitive tasks are the most at risk. So how can workers prepare for the AI-driven transformation of the labor market? Here’s a look at what’s coming, and what can be done about it. These include:

Administrative support (data entry, payroll, scheduling)

Transportation (drivers, delivery)

Retail and customer service

Basic manufacturing and warehouse jobs

Even white-collar jobs in finance, legal services, and journalism are starting to see AI encroach on tasks like report writing, contract analysis, and data interpretation.

Now we have many ways for you to find the spaces you love - including a leader board, personalized recommendations, improved onboarding for new users and others on the way. 

With all of that, and with the site continuing to grow, we’ve decided it’s now time to retire this community and the daily parade of trending communities. For the next week, ending on Sunday June 13, we’ll be hand selecting communities to feature based mainly on our whims in part to celebrate this little community and all the other communities it helped put on your radar.

Thanks to all of _you,_ users and mods, for making this and reddit a very special place. 

**We’ll see you on the flip side! <3**

Who emerged to find Jesus. Who was written off as a has-been by the end of the '80s and who suddenly shifted gears, releasing some of the strongest music of his career beginning in the late '90s.

Ladies and gentlemen — Columbia recording artist Bob Dylan!

This is a subforum supporting a community that avoids that filthy fifth glyph. Individuals in this community can post anything as long that fifth symbol of our ABC's is totally missing. This task can look daunting at first but it is not as hard as it looks. This is an arduous skill, it is not a trivial task. 

Join us and try posting a translation of that Rick Roll song in our quad-monthly translation trials.

,,,,,,,,all,I traveled solo to Japan to 'find myself' and ended up having this quiet moment in Kyoto that I can’t stop thinking about,"Hey everyone,  
I’ve been lurking here for a while and figured I’d finally share something from a recent trip. I just got back from three weeks in Japan, my first time traveling alone. I’m 26, recently single, and was feeling kind of stuck in life. Quit a job I hated, felt burnt out, and booked this trip hoping it would reset something in my brain.

And honestly, it did. But not in the way I expected.

Japan was incredible. I started in Tokyo, and the first night I just sat in a Lawson eating onigiri and felt like I was on another planet. It was loud and beautiful and confusing and amazing all at once. I kind of stumbled my way through the first week, but once I got used to it, I felt so free in a way I hadn’t in years.

The moment I want to share happened in Kyoto. I was trying to find this temple, Kiyomizu-dera, but my phone was on 4% and the directions were useless. I must’ve looked super lost because this older woman walking a little white dog stopped and said something to me in Japanese. I just pointed at the temple on my map and kinda shrugged.

She smiled and motioned for me to follow her. I thought she’d just point me in the right direction, but she actually walked with me the whole way. Like, 15 or 20 minutes through these quiet little side streets. We didn’t speak the same language, but it wasn’t awkward. She pointed out a few little things along the way like flowers or shrines and smiled every time I looked confused or amazed.

Her dog kept checking behind to make sure I was still there, which was somehow the cutest thing I’ve ever experienced.

When we got to the temple, I bowed and said thank you like five times. She just smiled, said something softly, and then turned around and walked back the way we came. Like it was nothing. Just helped a lost tourist without a second thought.

I don’t know. That moment has stayed with me more than any big tourist attraction. It was so simple, but so kind. I felt really seen in that moment, which was weird because we barely spoke.

Travel gives you these weird little memories that hit harder than you expect. I still think about her and her dog and that peaceful walk through Kyoto like it was a dream.

Have any of you had an experience like that? Where a stranger completely changed your day without even realizing it?",1568.0,120.0,2025-05-03 10:16:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1kdpo8b/i_traveled_solo_to_japan_to_find_myself_and_ended/,2025-05-03 11:43:36.606207
,,,,,,,,all,Update: AITAH for considering calling off my wedding because my fiancée refuses to sign a prenup after I found out she has a massive cedit card debt?,"it has been a tough few days for me after sharing my story here but I feel like I owe you guys an update about me situation so here it is

My first Post: I am just a middle aged man supposed to be getting married in a few months to my fiancée. We've been together for three years engaged for one and for most of that time I genuinely believed we were on the same page about life values and most importantly honesty. For background: I’ve worked hard to build a stable financial foundation. I’m not wealth, but I own my home outright, have no personal debt and I’ve been saving and investing since my early twenties. It’s been a priority for me especially since my parents went through a nasty divorce that ruined both of them financially. About a month ago, while we were discussing wedding costs, I brought up a prenup. Not in a cold or controlling way I just wanted to protect the life I’ve worked hard to build. I was upfront that I’d still be fair and the agreement wouldn’t leave her with nothing. I expected an adult conversation. Instead she immediately got defensive. She said things like So you’re already planning for a divorce? and I thought we trusted each other. I tried to explain it wasn’t about trust it was about transparency and mutual protection. But she shut it down completely. That’s when red flags started popping up. She became evasive every time money came up and I started noticing weird things credit card offers in the mail, a few missed payments on shared expenses she said she'd cover, and lots of I'll handle it later energy.

So, I asked directly if she had debt. She admitted it. $92,000 in credit card debt. Not student loans. Not a mortgage. Credit cards. She said it accumulated over the years from unexpected expenses and a few dumb splurges but she never told me about any of it until I forced the issue. I was stunned. We’re about to merge lives. This woman was about to legally become my spouse and she didn’t think I deserved to know she was six figures in the red? I told her this made the prenup non-negotiable for me. I need to protect myself not just emotionally, but financially. I told her I was willing to still move forward but not without something in writing that protects my premarital assets. She lost it. Called me selfish. Said I was turning love into a business deal. Said my house and money should be hers too if we’re truly a team. Since then, she’s refused to talk about the prenup again and we’re barely speaking. Even her mother called me and accused me of humiliating her daughter and being materialistic. All I want is to not be liable for debt I didn’t create and to make sure the life I built before this relationship is protected. So now I’m seriously reconsidering the whole wedding. Not because she has debt but because she hid it then refused to take responsibility and now is treating me like the bad guy for trying to protect myself. I'm almost certain that she could pay her debts since she is a part partner in her friend's business but she just refuses to. AITAH for thinking about walking away?

My final update: so I wasn’t planning to come back, but a lot of people messaged me and honestly… it’s been a hell of a few days. Figured I’d give an update. So yeah… the wedding is officially off. After I posted I tried one more time to talk to my fiancée (well, ex now). I told her I wasn’t trying to be cold or controlling I just needed to protect myself. I also said that if the roles were reversed, I’d completely understand if she wanted to do the same. I told her I could still move forward with the wedding if we signed a fair prenup. One that clearly said her debt is hers and my home/savings are mine if things go bad. I also said I’d go to therapy or counseling with her if this felt like a deeper trust issue. She didn’t take it well. Said again that the prenup was an insult and I was basically planning for divorce. Then she started crying and said I was humiliating her and that I was destroying everything we had built over money. But that’s the thing it’s not just about the money. It’s about the fact that she kept a massive amount of debt hidden until she had no choice but to tell me. And even then, she only told me because I pushed for it. That’s not partnership, that’s avoidance. So I told her I couldn’t go through with it. I called off the wedding. It sucked. It still sucks. We told the venue canceled what we could and let people know. Her family is furious. Mine has been supportive but trying not to say I told you so. I’ve lost a lot of money deposits suit some family flying in from out of state but honestly, that’s nothing compared to what could’ve happened if I had ignored my gut.

She moved out two days ago. We’ve barely spoken. I keep second-guessing myself, even now. I didn’t want this. But I also don’t want to wake up one day in financial ruin wondering why I ignored every red flag just to avoid hurting someone. Anyway, thanks for everyone who gave advice or just listened.

,,,,,,,,popular,AITAH for refusing to chip in for a coworker's wedding gift after literally being uninvited?,"Alright AITAH ppl, imma need your hot takes on this office drama that's been driving me insane

So I (27F) have been working at this marketing agency for about 2 years. My coworker Jess (31F) is getting married next month and initially invited our whole team (8 people) to her wedding. We're not like besties besties, but definitely friendly - lunch together sometimes, happy hours, the usual work friend stuff.

Last week our office manager Sarah started collecting money for a group gift. She's asking for $200 each which would get us some fancy kitchen gadget from their registry. That's basically what I'd budget for someone I'm actually friends with, but whatever, I was planning to contribute.

WELL. Yesterday I got the most awkward text from Jess saying they ""had to make some cuts to the guest list"" and unfortunately they couldn't accommodate me anymore. Something about venue capacity and family additions. But here's the kicker - I KNOW FOR A FACT that everyone else on our team is still invited!!! 🙃

This morning Sarah comes by my desk asking for my contribution to the gift fund. I politely told her that since I'm no longer invited, I'd rather get Jess a smaller gift on my own. Sarah looked shocked and said ""but it's a team gift"" and that not contributing the full amount would ""mess up the group harmony"" (like I give a single fuck)

The icing on the cake? I know the wedding cut was because Jess invited her old coworker who just got a VP position at a major client. Suddenly there's ""no room"" for me, but I'm still expected to drop $200 on her registry? The thing is that (I'm not trying to brag whatsoever), but I literally hit a 5k win on Jackpotcity like last weekend so that $200 isn't even a big deal, but what she did to me specifically is something I ain't gonna tolerate

Can someone please tell me the truth if I'm the asshole for refusing to contribute the full amount to a wedding I'm not even attending?",12699.0,1599.0,2025-05-02 15:49:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1kd4bec/aitah_for_refusing_to_chip_in_for_a_coworkers/,2025-05-03 11:43:36.606207
,,,,,,,,popular,Neighbor kept stealing our Amazon packages. So I mailed him something special.,"We kept losing packages. Security cams caught the culprit—our neighbor. Bold as ever, he’d walk right up and take boxes off our porch.

So I ordered a “special” delivery: a glitter bomb inside a fake package, timed for when he’d usually steal it. Sure enough, it vanished within hours.

Thirty minutes later, I heard yelling. Glitter everywhere. He hasn’t touched a single box since. Our packages? Arriving safely now.

,,,,,,,,popular,TIFU by losing my fiance over crypto,"So, yeah, I totally screwed up big time. Me and my fiance, Jess, been together 4 years, engaged for 1. Everything was great, we was planning our wedding, picking venues and all that. But then I got sucked into crypto, specifically Solana. I thought I was gonna be some genius investor, you know?

It started when I saw some X posts about memecoins, that they are like super fast, cheap fees, blah blah. I’m not rich, but I had like 10k saved up for the wedding. I figured, why not throw 5k into those coins? Make a quick buck, surprise Jess with a fancier honeymoon. I didn’t tell her, cause I wanted it to be a surprise.

Big mistake. i lost everything in the first few weeks. My 10k was gone. I was freaking out, couldn’t sleep. Jess noticed I was acting weird, kept asking what’s wrong. I didn’t wanna tell her I blew our wedding fund, so I lied, said it was work stress.

She found out anyway. I left my laptop open, and she saw the trading app, the red numbers, the whole mess. She flipped out, screaming how I gambled our future without even telling her. I tried to explain, said I’d make it back. She wasn’t having it. Said I broke her trust, acted like some sneaky addict. She gave me back the ring, packed a bag, and left to her mom’s.

That was 2 weeks ago. She’s barely talking to me, says she needs space. 

TL;DR: I secretly blew our wedding fund on crypto, lost it all, and my fiance left me cause I lied about it.",2548.0,772.0,2025-05-02 22:50:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1kde7wd/tifu_by_losing_my_fiance_over_crypto/,2025-05-03 13:01:18.312024
,,,,,,,,all,Rape videos do not violate reddit's rules,"Last night and video was posted on terrifyingasfuck about a woman who was sedated for a c-section and the physician put his penis in her mouth while she was under. He was recorded because the nursing staff put hidden cameras in as they were concerned about what he might be doing.

I tried to report it to reddit, but there wasn't a category that 100% matched. Regardless, I reported it as ""non-consentual intimate content.""

This morning I woke up to learn that reddit had reviewed the post and determined that it did not break reddit's site wide rules.

So that's it. Reddit condones rape videos. I knew this site had problems, but I never expected this.",1468.0,107.0,2025-05-03 11:07:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1kdqglh/rape_videos_do_not_violate_reddits_rules/,2025-05-03 13:31:43.506340

,,,,,,,,popular,"AITAH for telling bf his body hair looks terrible, when he tried me to shame me for having a bush?","I am 26f and resident in anesthesia branch. My work schedule is heavy. Though in some years, I will earn well though. And I barely get time for going to parlour etc. As I just want to rest on Sundays. Note I am very well maintained girl and like to keep myself groomed, stylish. My bf 28m is civil engineer.

He was at my place and we got cosy. I am not super hairy, but had some hair down there. After we had fun, he told me he got disgusted by hair down there and why  am i not mainting my hygiene? Note I keep myself super clean and before we got cosy. I took bath and applied lotions. I asked did he smell something? He said those hair looks bad and he likes me smooth.

I got irritated and said his nose hair need to be trimmed,  because they look so big and I felt disgusted to kiss him, when they touched my lips. I told him he hasn't trimmed his chest hair in whole. They are touching his neck .

He got offended and isn't talking to me. But I won't apologise. He said i didn't smell bad. Then i told him he is super hairy and he should be mature enough to understand that I am not a p**n star to be hairless all the time.  Did i take it too far? Though this morning he has trimmed it all lmao. 

Though I like chest hair when they are not coming out of your shirt buttons.

Edit. People do your research. Having pubes doesn't equate to bring unhygienic. You have to keep it clean and you are well to go. And atleast I don't have back hair as well as countless hair all over the body. But I never shamed him for them

Edit two. I am not going to breakup over this unless it becomes pattern. We will have discussion..we have done many good things for each other over the last three years. 

Edit three. Please stop telling me to breakup. I am here for yta or nta or esh. Also he didn't call me disgusting. He said he find pubes disgusting. There is lots of difference. 

We will have discussion like adults soon. I don't see this road bump as reason to breakup. If he isn't willing to change his attitude, I will though. I am not a pushover. But I am not someone who believes in breakingup over this.",3689.0,1227.0,2025-05-02 22:24:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1kddn71/aitah_for_telling_bf_his_body_hair_looks_terrible/,2025-05-03 13:31:43.506340
