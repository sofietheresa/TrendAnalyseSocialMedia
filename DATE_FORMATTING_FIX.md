# Date Formatting Fix

## Issue

The frontend was not displaying correct dates in the pipeline and model evaluation components because:

1. The API was returning hardcoded dates from 2023 (December 13-15, 2023)
2. These dates, when displayed with `toLocaleString()` in the frontend, looked outdated

## Solution

### Backend Changes

1. Modified all MLOPS API endpoints to use dynamic dates based on the current time:
   - Current date (`datetime.now()`)
   - Yesterday (`current_time - timedelta(days=1)`)
   - Tomorrow (`current_time + timedelta(days=1)`)
   - Other relative dates (one week ago, two weeks ago, etc.)

2. Added additional endpoints for complete model evaluation support:
   - `/api/mlops/models/{model_name}/metrics`
   - `/api/mlops/models/{model_name}/versions`

### Date Formatting in the API

All dates are returned in ISO format (`2025-05-16T09:15:00.000000`), which is properly parsed by the frontend's date formatting functions:

```javascript
const formatDate = (dateString) => {
  if (!dateString) return 'N/A';
  return new Date(dateString).toLocaleString('de-DE');
};
```

## Benefits

1. Shows realistic, current dates in the frontend
2. Makes the application feel up-to-date and active
3. Maintains the same data structure and format that was already expected by the frontend

## Deployment

The changes have been pushed to the repository and will be automatically deployed to the production environment by Railway.

## Verification

After deployment, you can verify the fix by:

1. Visiting the Pipeline page and checking that the dates shown are current
2. Visiting the Model Evaluation page and verifying that model versions show recent dates
3. Confirming that execution timestamps show recent days/times
