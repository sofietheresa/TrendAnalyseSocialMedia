# Presentation Slides Directory

Place your presentation slides as images in this directory with the following naming convention:
- slide1.jpg
- slide2.jpg
- slide3.jpg
- etc.

For optimal performance, resize your images to a consistent aspect ratio (16:9 recommended)
and keep file sizes below 500KB per image.

In production, you would typically:
1. Convert your PowerPoint/Keynote slides to JPG/PNG images
2. Rename them sequentially (slide1.jpg, slide2.jpg, etc.)
3. Place them in this directory

You could also use a service like Google Slides with an embed code or a PDF viewer
instead of using individual images.
