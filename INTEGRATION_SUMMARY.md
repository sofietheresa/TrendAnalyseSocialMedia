# API Integration Summary

## Completed Tasks

1. **Merged APIs**: Successfully integrated the separate drift API (drift_api.py) into the main FastAPI application (src/main.py)
   - Added all MLOPS endpoints to the main API
   - Ensured consistent handling of model drift metrics
   - Improved import handling to support both direct and relative imports

2. **Configuration Updates**:
   - Updated the main API to run on port 8002
   - Created comprehensive documentation (API_INTEGRATION.md)
   - Updated environment variables and connection settings

3. **Frontend Integration**:
   - Removed dual-API approach in the frontend
   - Updated the API service to use a single unified endpoint
   - Updated documentation to reflect the new configuration
   - Configured the default API URL to point to the unified API at http://localhost:8002

4. **Testing**:
   - Verified functionality of all endpoints in the unified API
   - Confirmed that the frontend can successfully connect to the API
   - Validated proper response formats from the API

## Benefits

1. **Simplified Architecture**: The application now uses a single API instead of two separate services, making deployment and maintenance easier.

2. **Improved Reliability**: Eliminated the fallback logic that was previously needed to handle multiple API endpoints, reducing complexity and potential points of failure.

3. **Better Development Experience**: Developers now only need to run a single API service when working on the application.

4. **Cleaner Codebase**: Removed duplicate code and simplified the API client in the frontend.

## Next Steps

1. **Clean Up**: The drift_api.py file can now be removed from production use (though it may be kept for reference).

2. **Update Deployment Configurations**: Update any deployment scripts or configurations to only deploy the main API.

3. **Documentation**: Ensure all team members are aware of the changes and update any relevant project documentation.

4. **Monitor Performance**: Keep an eye on the performance of the unified API to ensure it can handle the increased load from handling both sets of endpoints.

## Conclusion

The API integration has successfully unified what were previously two separate services into a single, cohesive API. This improves the maintainability of the codebase and simplifies the architecture of the application.
