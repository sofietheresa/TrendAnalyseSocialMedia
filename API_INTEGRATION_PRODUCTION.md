# Production API Integration

This document explains how the ML Operations API endpoints were integrated into the production application.

## Overview

The system previously had two separate API implementations:
1. The main FastAPI application (`app/main.py`) - deployed on Railway
2. A dedicated "drift API" (`drift_api.py`) for ML operations

We've successfully integrated all MLOPS endpoints from the drift API into the main API so that they're available in the production environment.

## Integration Details

### Added Endpoints

The following MLOPS endpoints have been added to `app/main.py`:

1. **Model Drift Endpoint**
   - Path: `/api/mlops/models/{model_name}/drift`
   - Method: GET
   - Description: Returns drift metrics for a specific model

2. **Pipeline Endpoints**
   - Path: `/api/mlops/pipelines`
   - Method: GET
   - Description: Lists all available ML pipelines

3. **Pipeline Details Endpoint**
   - Path: `/api/mlops/pipelines/{pipeline_id}`
   - Method: GET
   - Description: Returns details for a specific pipeline

4. **Pipeline Executions Endpoint**
   - Path: `/api/mlops/pipelines/{pipeline_id}/executions`
   - Method: GET
   - Description: Lists all executions for a specific pipeline

5. **Pipeline Execution Endpoint**
   - Path: `/api/mlops/pipelines/{pipeline_id}/execute`
   - Method: POST
   - Description: Executes a specific pipeline

### Data Models

Added Pydantic models for:
- `DriftMetrics` - Structure for model drift data
- `PipelineExecution` - Structure for pipeline execution data

## Deployment

1. All changes were committed to the repository with the message "Add MLOPS endpoints to app/main.py for integrated API functionality"
2. Railway will automatically deploy the updated code when the changes are pushed to the main branch.

## Verification

After deploying, you can verify the integration by:

1. Visiting the API documentation: `https://trendanalysesocialmedia-production.up.railway.app/docs`
2. Checking for the new MLOPS endpoints in the documentation
3. Testing the endpoints by making API calls to:
   - `https://trendanalysesocialmedia-production.up.railway.app/api/mlops/pipelines`
   - `https://trendanalysesocialmedia-production.up.railway.app/api/mlops/models/topic_model/drift`

## Frontend Integration

The frontend has been updated to use a single API endpoint (the main API) instead of having separate fallback logic. This simplifies the architecture and prevents unnecessary API calls.
