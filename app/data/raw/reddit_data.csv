all,AITA for breaking up with my bf after he didn't stop when I was hurt,"I (19F) was with my boyfriend (26M) and we were doing it in bed. I've only done it a few times, and this time things started off fine, but at some point he sped up and it started to hurt. I told him ""Hey, slow down, that hurts"" and he slowed down but it didn't help and so I told him ""its really hurting now, can we stop please"".

He kind of froze for a second, then said, ""I'm literally about to finish babe, it feels so good, just give me a second"" and held my hips while he kept going and I sort of muttered ""no it hurts"" as he continued. I didn't physically push him off or yell or anything, I just kept saying ""it hurts"" and ""babe"" as he went for maybe 30 more seconds and then he finished.

I got up and went to the bathroom to clean. He followed me after a bit and acted like everything was fine, but I felt... weird. He said he thought I didn't really want him to stop and I didn't move and he thought I was liking it. I ended up leaving and called him later that we need to break up.

He was upset and told me that he genuinely thought I was okay with him finishing because I didn't move and he thought I was liking it since I was grunting a little, and that he thought I was just a little uncomfortable. He said it felt so good and he felt like he had to finish because he was so close. He said he thought I'd do the same if I was on top and the roles were reversed. My friend told me it seemed like just a miscommunication and breaking up was unfair.

all,Some upper management walked in on a random goodbye party and now it‚Äôs really tense‚Ä¶,"I don‚Äôt even know how to write this correctly, but it‚Äôs laughable how management thinks.

Work in biotech as a service provider associated with a big company that outsources everything. Though this is particular to my company, not the big boys we provide service to.

Anyways, a member of the facilities team was leaving, so we had a brief little pizza party/cake on our lunch break on Friday. A bigger boss, about 2 steps above my direct manager, pops in randomly and asks what‚Äôs going on. Turns out the facilities member leaving wasn‚Äôt something he was aware of, etc. Their team is already gutted and only has 2 of the normal 5 man team they need. People leaving, etc.

The leaving team member had not alerted our company to him leaving (he was quitting that day) and most of us found out that in that moment. Today, Monday, boss pops in and says we all are in big trouble because we all had a party on Friday and didn‚Äôt let management know. That it could be seen as time fraud, etc. That they may restructure our office area in response and possibly a window on the office door.

I just find it really odd that this entire response occurred when it should be more of a time for introspection or investigation as to the why. Based on my understanding, the whole ‚ÄúI‚Äôm quitting but not telling you‚Äù stems from poor management in that groups chain of command. Why are other teams getting flak for things beyond our control? It‚Äôs just so archaic and foolish, I‚Äôm surprised this person is even in management.",4046,235,2025-04-14 14:46:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1jyxzud/some_upper_management_walked_in_on_a_random/,2025-04-14 20:31:29.692066

trendingreddits,Suicidal 1,"Dear Friend,

My name is Denzo, and I write this letter with a heart weighed down by despair and desperation. I find myself in a place I never imagined‚Äîa place where I feel completely alone, broken, and overwhelmed by life‚Äôs burdens.

Every day has become a struggle to survive. I owe money to someone, and that debt is like a dark shadow that follows me everywhere. I haven‚Äôt had a decent meal in days, and the gnawing hunger only adds to the constant ache inside me. I trusted those I called friends, only to be left behind when I needed them the most. Now, with no one to turn to, the loneliness and hopelessness have pushed me to the brink. I‚Äôve even started to wonder if ending it all might be the only escape from this crushing pain.

I know this may sound desperate, but I‚Äôm reaching out with a plea for help. I need just some money to pull myself back from the edge‚Äîa small amount that could be the first step toward getting food, safety, and a chance to seek the help I desperately need. This isn‚Äôt just about money; it‚Äôs about having a lifeline when everything seems lost.

If you can find it in your heart to help, no matter how small the contribution, you would be giving me a reason to believe that there is still hope in this dark world. Your kindness could be the spark that reignites my will to live and helps me find a way to rebuild my shattered life.

Thank you for taking the time to read my plea. I hold onto the hope that someone out there understands my pain and will offer the hand I so desperately need.

With all the hope I have left,

Denzo",3,4,2025-03-15 01:24:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrendingReddits/comments/1jbipra/suicidal_1/,2025-04-14 20:31:29.692066

Who emerged to find Jesus. Who was written off as a has-been by the end of the '80s and who suddenly shifted gears, releasing some of the strongest music of his career beginning in the late '90s.

Ladies and gentlemen ‚Äî Columbia recording artist Bob Dylan!

You know in games or movies when you find a odd little secret that someone in production left unnoticed for the few in the audience that would look for it or happen to stumble upon it?  This is the place to share those things you find in real life. 

This isn‚Äôt the area for posting digital Easter eggs, as in screenshots or photographs of screens (games, computer software, TV series, DVD menus); as those are regular Easter eggs and not IRL Easter eggs. Try /r/EasterEggs for such things.

popular,AITA for turning my sister away for the second time after she slept with the father of my children while I was with him and then came to me when he cheated and passed on STDs/STIs to her?,"I (27f) have three children with my now ex Kon (29m). 10 months ago my sister (26f) confessed that she and Kon had slept together the week before and she said she regretted it and needed us to be okay. She told me it was a mistake and she got caught up in a moment because she had a crush on Kon and she needed me not to hate her for it. That she loved me and wanted us to make things work. Kon didn't even try to deny it. He told me he'd been sleeping around for years and that he slept with my sister more than once. My sister denied it strongly. I broke up with him immediately and told her to get lost. I said I never wanted to see her again and that she disgusted and repulsed me and I didn't care how bad she felt, I wanted her to feel bad, I wanted her to hurt and she would never hurt as much as I was right then so forget about me.

I got checked after I broke up with Kon to make sure he didn't give me anything with all the cheating. I was negative for all STDs and I'm incredibly thankful for that. With the amount of cheating he talked about I'm still surprised I didn't catch anything.

She ended up dating Kon because I rejected her. Or that was the story she told others. She said she felt guilty and needed some good to come from this because clearly I would never give her the time of day again. And that's true. I swore to myself that I would not forgive her. Even through therapy I have become more secure in the belief that what she did broke our relationship beyond repair and regardless of whether it was one time (which I don't believe) or a full affair it was wrong and we'll never come back from it. I really don't care what happens to her and if she died tomorrow I would not grieve or make an appearance at her funeral. 

Recently my sister found out Kon had cheated on her and he didn't only cheat but he passed along some STDs/STIs. I don't know specifics. I believe she's also waiting to make sure he didn't give her HIV. Although I can't say I paid enough attention to know if that was a big concern or just them being cautious. But she thought that experience would make me more forgiving of her. She was wrong. She showed up at my place and I shut the door in her face without saying a word. She showed up at our brothers house while I was heading inside and he shooed her but she told me how sorry she was again and how scared she was and how much she needed me. I ignored her and kept going and our brother told her she wasn't welcome.

She tried again and this time I did respond. I told her I do not care and if anything she deserves everything she got after what she did and how stupid she was in the end. She told me she needed me and that she was scared. I told her just like when I found out my partner of 8 years and father of my children was cheating and I could have used my sister only she betrayed me as well by cheating with him. She said it was one time and she would have been there for me and I told her I didn't want her disgusting self to touch me. Because I said that's how I saw her now a disgusting backstabber. I told her I don't care if he's given her every STD under the sun, because I want nothing more to do with her and she can die in a hole for all I care.

I haven't seen her since. Apparently she's very distraught and she's also the topic of gossip in our social circles. She lost most of our shared friends and a few have shared a similar sentiment to me on her. But a couple have asked me if I don't even feel a little bad for being so cruel to her and turning her away a second time even after all her apologies. They said they felt like I should have found a way to work through this because we were close for such a long time and sisters are for life or whatever stupid crap they said.

I don't feel guilty. I don't even feel bad for her or have any kind of empathy. AITA though?",4192,606,2025-04-14 14:12:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1jyxblg/aita_for_turning_my_sister_away_for_the_second/,2025-04-14 21:09:03.112324

all,Fuck All Ya'll,"2025 has sucked. I have been full of barely contained rage since November, but today's press conference where the current administration laughed while refusing a SCOTUS order and talking about sending anyone they deemed a ""violent criminal"" to CECOT was my breaking point.

My fucks to give are gone. I did not spend more than two decades fighting terrorists and despots to watch the country turn into a terrorist nation run by a despot. 

So, all that said:

Trump, fuck you. 

Vance, fuck you. 

Mike Johnson, fuck you. 

Stephen Miller, fuck you too. 

Elon Musk, fuck you. 

Vought, Thiel, and The Heritage Foundation; fuck all ya'll.

Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, fuck you. Roberts, Kavanaugh, and Coney-Barret, I challenge you to do the right thing and fix the fuck ups you have had. 

Rubio, Hegseth, and the entire Trump administration, fuck you. 

Anyone who wears a fucking Trump lapel pin or supports MAGA, fuck you too. 

If you're not into actual civil liberties and ""justice for all,"" fuck all ya'll.

It is time for the Judicial and Legislative branches to do their jobs and REMOVE Trump. It is time for the Republican party to take back their party and REPLACE the MAGA parasites. 

It is time for the Democratic party to stop being complicit, find their courage, and REPAIR our broken nation.

Do not sit down. Do not remain silent. Say fuck you to that fat, orange fuck ruining the country and RECLAIM the term ""FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT!""

Do everything you can to effect positive change. 

Fuck 'em.

EDIT 1: Thanks to the folks who've pointed out my incorrect names of a couple of SCOTUS folks. I was fat-fingering that in the passenger seat of a moving car while suppressing my rage. 

EDIT 2: By popular demand, I added Stephen Miller. 

EDIT 3: No idea how I forgot that fucker Elon. I actually got rid of my Tesla because of that shithead.",10340,819,2025-04-15 00:17:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/50501/comments/1jzbntu/fuck_all_yall/,
all,I held on too long and all it did was hurt my daughter,"My daughter had multiple congenital birth defects that led to a lifetime of complications. With medically complex kids you fix one problem and create two more.

 She lived 11 years. It was probably 9 years too long. She lived most of her life in hospitals. Literally months at a time. She would sometimes be home a week or two and then end up back in. I don't think she ever spent more than two consecutive months out of the hospital in her entire life, until she went on palliative care. 

She was more comfortable in the hospital than anywhere else. How sad is that. She was the ""warrior"" kid. That was her whole identity. Making cards for her nurses and decorating her medical equipment and being Tough with a capital T. That was all she had. Never went to school, not in any meaningful capacity. Never played a sport or an instrument. Never had any real friends to speak of. Never had the health to take up any real hobbies. Just an entire life made up of surgeries, shots and nurses and fucking medical equipment to decorate. I gave her a pathetic life. 

There wasn't a single intervention I wasn't willing to put her through to buy more time. She was the happiest, most accepting kid I've ever met but in the last six months she was done. I refused to listen. She asked me over and over again if she could just ""stop"". I would push until she shut up and went along with what I wanted. Why did I do that. She wanted to make me happy but she knew she was done. Selfish. She died incredibly agitated and upset. I think she was scared to let go because she knew what it was going to do to me. I wasn't strong enough to let go. I'm so so sorry. ",4575,193,2025-04-15 03:48:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1jzg3w9/i_held_on_too_long_and_all_it_did_was_hurt_my/,

all,AITA - told mom she can bill me using the tuition money she stole from me,"When I (m33) was preparing to go to uni, my mom confessed that there was no tuition money for me. Through the years my dad would give her cash to deposit but she only did the first one. She spent the rest. TBH I wasn't even surprised. I was used to being disappointed by her. She promised that she would ""pay me back"" and asked that I never tell me dad. So for four years I thanked them for the tuition money while I took out loans.

For reasons to do with her narcissism, I have an arms length relationship with her, but she would say we're pretty close as she assumes my smiling and nodding while she drones on about the same stories is a relationship.

We have a family cottage that she puts above everything else. She lives there about 90 days of the year. I've been going there with my gf for about 4 days for a couple summers which she begrudges as it takes away from her time. My dad supports my going which is how I pull it off. 

She recently told me that it was time for me to start paying for some of the maintenance on the cottage since I use it. She actually suggested 1k which is wildly disproportionate. I told her she could take it out of the tuition IOU and we could negotiate the amount with dad.

She was speechless. She texted me later to say that it manipulative to bring up the tuition and to threaten to tell dad. It went on and on. 

I've been thinking about it and First, I'm hurt/offended that she can't just do a nice thing for me, she has to get something for it. 
Second, I guess I'm not really over the whole tuition thing. 

WITAH for bringing up ancient history and not paying her for use of the cottage?

Edited to add: at the time, it never occurred to me that I should have told him. I thought I was doing the right thing by protecting both of them. That pretty much summarizes my childhood.

popular,"AITA for asking my husband not to go on a trip with a woman who openly flirts with him, and feeling betrayed when he did anyway?","Hi everyone,
I‚Äôm a 32F and I‚Äôve been married to my husband (let's call him Joe) for 8 years, together for 10. In all that time, we‚Äôve always prioritized each other‚Äôs emotional well-being. If something hurt one of us, we didn‚Äôt do it again ‚Äî no matter what. We valued having a happy spouse more than being ‚Äúright.‚Äù Because of this, my love and trust for him grew immensely. I was certain he‚Äôd never do anything that would break my heart.

But here I am, heartbroken and disappointed.

Joe owns a company, and we work together. Financially, we‚Äôre in a great place. Recently, through Joe‚Äôs father, we got the chance to bid for a major government contract ‚Äî a massive opportunity. Due to its scale, several companies are teaming up, and one key company involved (without whom the deal won‚Äôt happen) is led by a very attractive, flirty woman. She‚Äôs the CEO and has openly flirted with Joe in front of me.

We both noticed her behavior, and in order to avoid misunderstandings or conflict, we decided to work on the bid together. Things were okay until one meeting where, during a break, she touched Joe‚Äôs arm and said something like, ‚ÄúIf I had a husband like you, I‚Äôd never leave his side. You‚Äôre someone every woman wants, but sometimes even that‚Äôs not enough ‚Äî someone else might steal your mind.‚Äù

I snapped and responded, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not following him ‚Äî he just never leaves my side.‚Äù
She brushed it off as a joke, but I know it wasn‚Äôt. I saw the look in her eyes ‚Äî and women just know.

Later, I talked to Joe about it. He admitted she was crossing a line and that he was uncomfortable, but didn‚Äôt react strongly to avoid jeopardizing the deal. I wasn‚Äôt thrilled, but I tried to understand.

Then today, I found out that I was excluded from a 3-day site visit for the bid ‚Äî a trip requested by that woman. Only five people are going, and Joe is one of them. When I heard, I told him I was extremely uncomfortable with this, and asked him not to go. I begged, actually. I said the deal wasn‚Äôt worth this. We‚Äôre financially stable and don‚Äôt need this contract.

But he went anyway.
Even after everything I said, he left without me.

Something broke in me. I trusted him with my whole heart. I truly believed he‚Äôd never choose anything over my peace of mind. Now I feel like he did. He left me behind. And it hurts so deeply that part of me doesn‚Äôt even care anymore ‚Äî if he comes back, if he ends up with that woman ‚Äî I feel numb.

A part of me says, ‚ÄúCome on, 10 amazing years ‚Äî don‚Äôt throw it all away.‚Äù
Another part wants to take off my wedding ring, send him a photo, and file for divorce.

So... AITA for asking him not to go?
And how do I even begin to deal with these emotions?",2179,1617,2025-04-14 22:22:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1jz8znw/aita_for_asking_my_husband_not_to_go_on_a_trip/,
popular,When did you realize Elon Musk is a fraud?,"Do you recall where and when you realized Elon Musk's entire life, qualifications, career, and ""engineering knowledge"" are all a total fabrication? (Pre approved by mods)


I was on break at work in mid-2014 when I read a newspaper article in which he was pimping his latest snake oil and vaporware. He said something that my boss at the time would say from time to time.

My boss was a liar and a crook, took credit for every success, and placed blame on every failure that happened anywhere near him.

He's a textbook example of a narcissistic sociopath.

It clicked in my brain, and I realized Musk, like my boss, has never created a single thing. He comes up with an idea and tells people to get to work on it, assigning a due date that has absolutely no basis in reality, similar to ""It's March 20th. You can all cobble this together in a month. We'll release it on 4-20!!! It's going to be awesome because it's like a joke, it's funny!!!""

He makes promises that others have to fulfill, taking credit for the work everyone else had to do to develop the technology that didn't exist until the real engineers invented it.

My distaste took a year to morph into a loathing of everything that he stands for.

In the intervening decade, he's never let me down, continuing the grift, shady behavior, lying, and all-around bad behavior that I noticed 11 years ago.

>They needed to get the president alone.

>On April 9, financial markets were going haywire. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick wanted President Trump to put a pause on his aggressive global tariff plan. But there was a big obstacle: Peter Navarro, Trump‚Äôs tariff-loving trade adviser, who was constantly hovering around the Oval Office. 
> 
>Navarro isn‚Äôt one to back down during policy debates and had stridently urged Trump to keep tariffs in place, even as corporate chieftains and other advisers urged him to relent. And Navarro had been regularly around the Oval Office since Trump‚Äôs ‚ÄúLiberation Day‚Äù event. 
>So that morning, when Navarro was scheduled to meet with economic adviser Kevin Hassett in a different part of the White House, Bessent and Lutnick made their move, according to multiple people familiar with the intervention.
>
>They rushed to the Oval Office to see Trump and propose a pause on some of the tariffs‚Äîwithout Navarro there to argue or push back. They knew they had a tight window. The meeting with Bessent and Lutnick wasn‚Äôt on Trump‚Äôs schedule.
>
>The two men convinced Trump of the strategy to pause some of the tariffs and to announce it immediately to calm the markets. They stayed until Trump tapped out a Truth Social post, which surprised Navarro, according to one of the people familiar with the episode. Bessent and press secretary Karoline Leavitt almost immediately went to the cameras outside the White House to make a public announcement. 

So the Liberation Day steep tariff percentages were only put on a 90-day pause because Navarro was in a different room on that April 9th morning

popular,AITA for leaving my bf bday dinner after his mom took my seat?,"AITA for leaving my boyfriend‚Äôs birthday dinner after his mom took my seat ‚Äúas a joke‚Äù?

I (25F) have been dating my boyfriend Matt (27M) for almost two years. His family is *very* close, and his mom in particular has always been a little‚Ä¶ possessive? I‚Äôve tried not to make a big deal out of it, but it‚Äôs clear she doesn‚Äôt like that I ‚Äútake up his time,‚Äù and she‚Äôs made passive-aggressive comments like, ‚ÄúI hope I don‚Äôt lose my son to some girl,‚Äù even though we‚Äôve been together for a while and I‚Äôve made every effort to be kind and respectful to her.

Anyway, last weekend was Matt‚Äôs birthday. He invited me to dinner with his family at a nice restaurant. I dressed up, got him a gift I knew he‚Äôd love, and was honestly looking forward to the night.

When we arrived, I noticed his mom had saved the seat right next to him for herself. That‚Äôs fine, whatever ‚Äî I sat on his other side.

But right before we ordered, his mom made a ‚Äújoke‚Äù about how I always need to be next to Matt and said, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs see how you handle a little separation!‚Äù Then she literally stood up, looked at me, and said, ‚ÄúScooch, sweetie,‚Äù motioning for me to move down a seat so she could sit between us.

Everyone at the table laughed ‚Äî Matt included.

I was so stunned I just quietly got up and moved. For about five minutes I sat there, feeling small and humiliated while she leaned over Matt like he was her date.

So I stood up, grabbed my bag, and said, ‚ÄúActually, I think I‚Äôm gonna head out. Hope you have a great birthday, Matt.‚Äù And I left.

Matt blew up my phone later saying I *completely overreacted*, embarrassed him in front of his family, and ‚Äúcan‚Äôt take a joke.‚Äù His mom texted me a ‚Äúsorry you were so sensitive‚Äù message, which just made it worse.

Now he‚Äôs not speaking to me until I apologize. I honestly feel like they were the rude ones ‚Äî but it *was* his birthday dinner, so now I‚Äôm second-guessing everything.

AITA?

popular,"Euch ist nicht klar, wie viel eures Geld wirklich an die alte Generation flie√üt.","Letztens kam mir ein Gedanke: Als arbeitende Bev√∂lkerung zahlen wir nicht nur Rentenversicherungsbeitr√§ge f√ºr die √§ltere Generation. In Deutschland flie√üt noch viel mehr unserer Produktivit√§t an Rentner. Weil mich das am Wochenende besch√§ftigt hat, habe ich eine einfache Website erstellt, auf der ihr sehen k√∂nnt, wie viel eures Gehalts an die √§ltere Generation geht: https://rentner.pages.dev/ . (Und ihr k√∂nnt sogar eine Urkunde ausdrucken! :D)
Folgendes wird oft √ºbersehen:

- Die Krankenkasse funktioniert in Deutschland ebenfalls als Umlageverfahren, und bereits heute flie√üen 51,4 % der Ausgaben an Menschen √ºber 65.
- Die Pflegeversicherung.
- Ein gro√üer Teil eurer Steuern im Bundeshaushalt (ca. 20 %) wird als Zuschuss f√ºr die Rentenversicherung verwendet.
- Mit euren Steuern werden auch Pensionen finanziert. 2023 beliefen sich die Ausgaben des Staates f√ºr Pensionen, Hinterbliebenenversorgung und Beihilfen auf rund 85,9 Milliarden Euro.
- 8,2 % des GEZ-Beitrags gehen f√ºr Betriebsrenten drauf.

Ich wei√ü, es fehlt noch einiges (z. B. Kapitalertr√§ge, Umsatzsteuer) und manches ist vereinfacht (z. B. Steuerklassen). Ja, das bezieht den Arbeitgeberanteil mit ein. Trotzdem soll es euch sensibilisieren: Das System ist jetzt schon grenzwertig und wird mit jedem Jahr kritischer.

Und jetzt das Interessante: Die arbeitende Bev√∂lkerung scheint das gar nicht √§ndern zu wollen. Bei der letzten Bundestagswahl hat die Linke bei jungen W√§hlern den ersten Platz geholt. Die Linke will die Renten erh√∂hen, eine Mindestrente einf√ºhren, die √ºber dem heutigen Durchschnitt liegt, und das Renteneintrittsalter senken.

all,I cleaned the shower before going out for a night of reading at a local bar. My partner has no idea that that sequence of events just ended our 6 year relationship.,"Nearly 3 years of living in this spot and I can't remember if he's cleaned the damn thing once. He's lied about cleaning it after cleaning litter boxes and I would literally hop in to shower and feel the nastiness still sitting there in a layer of slime and grossness. I went on strike and haven't touched it and finally broke today.

Today I'm going out for live music and some reading at a local spot. I told myself I'd clean the litter boxes today so, before showering, I decided to dump em and scrub em in the shower. While sitting there, looking at the orange slime that has built up around the tub, I decided that I was finally done. 

Cleaned the litter boxes, sprayed down the tub and walls and curtain, then hopped in and scrubbed the whole thing down before cleaning myself. 

I rinsed brown/brackish water off of the walls multiple times. Scrubbed the orange slime away, and when I was done in the time I had it was STILL barely passable. It was sick. I can't believe I've been showering in this mess all while begging and pleading for this grown ass man to just fucking HELP OUT with the nasty ass apartment we have together. The kicker? He gets mad at ME when I get upset about things üòÇ apparently not using your Super Special Big Boy Cleanup Time Voice  and instead getting frustrated that a 28 year old man doesn't help out more makes you an evil bitch who doesn't understand how rude they are to people. Go figure. 

Anyway. Im done. I don't even think he realizes. I just continued getting ready and went along with my plans and walked out the door with barely a ""see you later"". I was arguing with him silently in my head the rest of the time but didn't even bother starting up for real because it genuinely was not worth ruining my night. 

Anyway. I just needed to get this off my chest. There's so much more I could rant about but having this feeling of being like ""actually, screw this. Im done.""

At that point I excused myself, said our values dont align and left her there.

popular,FINAL WARNING: Pierre Poilievre Is a Danger to Canada,"**FINAL WARNING: Pierre Poilievre Is a Danger to Canada**  
*This is a direct message to every Canadian who values truth, compassion, and democracy.*

Canada is on the brink of catastrophe. This upcoming federal election isn‚Äôt just another round at the ballot box ‚Äî it is the most important election of your lifetime. This is the moment that will define who we are as a country. This is your *final warning*.

¬† and the Conservative Party are not just wrong for Canada ‚Äî they are a **threat** to everything Canada stands for. If you think we‚Äôre exaggerating, look south of the border. The United States ignored the warnings. They embraced Donald Trump, a narcissistic, authoritarian figure propped up by billionaires and conspiracy theorists. Their democracy has never recovered. And now, we are staring down a mirror image of that disaster ‚Äî right here, at home, in Pierre Poilievre.

Make no mistake: **Pierre Poilievre is Canada's Trump.**  
He idolizes Donald Trump. He echoes the same rhetoric. He amplifies the same hate. He promotes the same division and chaos. And now, he has cozied up to **Elon Musk**, one of the richest men alive, who has shown blatant disregard for truth, workers' rights, or public good ‚Äî just like Poilievre.

**Here‚Äôs what Pierre Poilievre truly stands for:**

* **Anti-union**: Poilievre has consistently voted *against* workers‚Äô rights and *against* union protections. He has no interest in protecting the working class ‚Äî his loyalty lies with CEOs, not you.
* **Wants to cut the federal dental plan**, which helps millions of Canadians. Under his leadership, the working class will suffer while the wealthy celebrate.
* **Plans to slash healthcare**, pushing us toward a privatized system where only the rich get proper care.
* **Will gut public services**, laying off public sector workers and slashing budgets that keep our communities safe and supported.
* **Will sell us out**: He will **bow to Trump**, **sell our industries to the U.S.**, and even make backroom deals with **China**, putting our sovereignty and economy at risk.
* **Does not value women**: He has a history of ignoring women's rights, supporting regressive policies, and surrounding himself with misogynistic voices.
* **Has spread lies**: His entire campaign is built on *fabricated numbers*, *false promises*, and *gaslighting the public*.
* **Supports extremist ideologies**: He‚Äôs flirted with conspiracy theorists and has amplified hate-filled voices.
* **Anti-science, anti-progress**: From climate denial to blocking advancements in green jobs, he drags Canada backward.
* **Opposes reconciliation with Indigenous peoples**, showing disregard for justice, truth, and healing.
* **Wants to criminalize dissent**, clamping down on protests and threatening your right to speak up.
* **Pushes culture wars**, division, and fear over unity and hope.
* **Wants to turn our media into state-run mouthpieces** or destroy them altogether.
* **Stokes racism and division**, because he knows hate wins votes when truth doesn‚Äôt.
* **He will not govern ‚Äî he will rule**, and if elected, democracy as we know it will never be the same.

This is not fear-mongering. This is *reality*.

**If you are thinking about voting for Pierre Poilievre, understand this:**

¬†¬†

This is not about left vs. right anymore ‚Äî this is about **Canada vs. collapse**.

¬†  
If you haven‚Äôt voted yet ‚Äî **vote to protect your country, your community, your children‚Äôs future.**  
Do not fall for his lies. Do not become a cautionary tale. Open your eyes, Canada. Wake up, before it‚Äôs too late.

Because when democracy dies, it never announces itself with a bang. It dies slowly ‚Äî through the election of men like Pierre Poilievre, while good people stay silent.

**Ask yourself: How much do you value your democracy?**

popular,It's time to start being blatantly rude to those with no situational and spatial awareness,"I don't know if I'm just noticing it more and more, or if this is actually becoming more of a problem, but there are SO many people wandering around in the world with a complete lack of awareness of what's happening around them. 

I'm talking about the type of people who block entire aisles in grocery stores, who stop in front of doors, who walk three people side by side by side on the sidewalk and expect everyone else to walk on the road or mud to get around them. People who walk against the flow of traffic, who block the width of a busy escalator then stop as soon as they step off, or who just wander into a crosswalk without even looking to see if a car is coming.

We need to stop accommodating these people by being polite and thoughtful and considerate. We need to start being blatant assholes to them, because nothing else we do seems to be working. Don't say ""excuse me"", say ""get out of the way."" Don't skirt around a group of people blocking an entire pathway - walk through the middle of their group.

popular,AITA for refusing to cover my tattoos for my boyfriend‚Äôs family dinner?,"I‚Äôm (21F) a girl who has several tattoos (some big and quite visible), my boyfriend (26M) met me like that and I hadn't had any problem with it.  
He invited me to go to dinner with his family and I accepted, but he casually mentioned, ‚ÄúMaybe you could wear something with sleeves? Just so we don‚Äôt start any drama.‚Äù I asked what he meant, and he said his grandparents are very old-school and might not react well to my tattoos. He said he didn‚Äôt want the night to be awkward.  
I told him I wasn‚Äôt going to hide part of myself to make his family more comfortable. He said it‚Äôs not about hiding, it‚Äôs about respect. I told him respect goes both ways, and I shouldn‚Äôt have to pretend to be someone I‚Äôm not.  
He got upset and said I was overreacting and making it a bigger deal than it is. I told him that I would go to the dinner but that I wouldn't cover my tattoos. But then he asked me to please not attend, that if I was only going to be difficult, it would be better not to be there.  
That really rubbed me the wrong way and made me feel confused, because I think maybe I did behave badly and I shouldn't have reacted so vehemently against the idea. I don't want to cause drama with his family, but I have had a hard time feeling comfortable in my skin and learning to deal with the stigma people have towards me because of my tattoos... and I don't want to go back and hide again, plus I don't think I would be honest with his family either if I show myself as I am not.

So... AITA for refusing to cover my tattoos for the dinner?",3725,1490,2025-04-23 00:50:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1k5jzjb/aita_for_refusing_to_cover_my_tattoos_for_my/,2025-04-23 12:56:52.751422
popular,YSK How to stop a dog attack.,"Why YSK: After seeing multiple posts about dog attacks and people in the comments giving absolutely terrible advice, you should know the only proven way to stop a dog attack is by oxygen deprivation.

Using a spare lead, pass the rope or cord under the attacking dog‚Äôs neck, then pass it through the loop and cinch it tight like a noose. Hold it until the dog releases it‚Äôs target either for air or until it passes out.

Do not use your hands to try to pry the dog‚Äôs mouth open. Do not try to make loud noises as it will likely heighten the attacking dog. Do not try to use your own body to attempt to subdue the dog whether by holding it down or trying to choke it yourself. For god sake don‚Äôt stick your finger up it‚Äôs butt. The only way is to force the dog to try to breathe by depriving it of oxygen.

Edit: This is advice for a dog attacking another dog or animal. If you suspect a dog may attack you try get up high like on a car. If the attack is imminent, cross your arms against your chest & try to maintain your stance & hope it loses interest. If you are pulled to the ground maintain crossed arms, ball-up, & protect your vital organs & face & pray it loses interest or someone can help.",9341,1248,2025-04-22 22:15:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/1k5gc9o/ysk_how_to_stop_a_dog_attack/,2025-04-23 12:56:52.751422
popular,Tesla reports disappointing quarterly results as automotive revenue plunges 20%,"Tesla¬†reported a miss on the top and bottom lines in its first-quarter earnings report on Tuesday as automotive revenue plunged 20% from a year earlier.

Here are the key numbers compared with LSEG expectations.

* **Earnings per share**: 27 cents adjusted vs. 39 cents estimated
* **Revenue**: $19.34 billion vs. $21.11 billion estimated

Total revenue slid 9% from $21.3 billion a year earlier. Automotive revenue dropped 20% to $14 billion from $17.4 billion in the same period last year.

Tesla said one reason for the decline was the need to update lines at its four vehicle factories to start making a refreshed version of its popular Model Y SUV. The company also pointed to lower average selling prices and sales incentives as a drag on revenue and profit.

Net income plummeted 71% to $409 million, or 12 cents a share, from $1.39 billion or 41 cents a year ago.

It‚Äôs been a brutal start to the year for Tesla, with CEO¬†Elon Musk¬†spending much of his time in¬†President Donald Trump‚Äôs White House, overseeing an effort to dramatically downsize the federal government. The president‚Äôs sweeping tariffs plan has led to concerns that costs will increase for parts and materials crucial for electric vehicle production, including manufacturing equipment,¬†automotive glass, printed circuit boards and battery cells.

Tesla shares are down 41% so far in 2025, and suffered their worst quarterly drop since 2022 in the period that ended in March. The stock was little changed in extended trading on Tuesday.

The company refrained from promising growth this year and said it will ‚Äúrevisit our 2025 guidance in our Q2 update.‚Äù

In its shareholder deck, Tesla cautioned investors that ‚Äúuncertainty in the automotive and energy markets continues to increase as rapidly evolving trade policy adversely impacts the global supply chain and cost structure of Tesla and our peers.‚Äù The company said this ‚Äúdynamic,‚Äù and ‚Äúchanging political sentiment‚Äù could have a meaningful near-term impact on demand for its products.

Tesla has faced widespread protests in the U.S. and Europe, where Musk has actively supported Germany‚Äôs far-right AfD party. Earlier this month, the company¬†reported¬†a 13% decline in first quarter deliveries from a year earlier to 336,681.

Tesla has been struggling to keep pace with lower-cost competitors in China, and is a laggard in the robotaxi market, which is currently dominated in the U.S. by¬†Alphabet‚Äôs¬†Waymo. The company has promised to launch its¬†first driverless ride-hailing offering¬†in Austin, Texas, in June.

The company reassured investors on Tuesday that it remains on track for a ‚Äúpilot launch‚Äù in Austin by that point, and to begin building its humanoid robots on a pilot production line in Fremont, California, this year.

Operating income in the quarter slid 66% to $400 million from $1.17 billion a year earlier, resulting in a 2.1% operating margin. The company cited an increase in expenses tied to artificial intelligence projects as one factor in the decline.

The company would have lost money on automotive sales without environmental regulatory credits during the quarter. Revenue from the credits, which Tesla receives for selling fully electric vehicles, increased to $595 million from $432 million in the same quarter last year.

Energy generation and storage revenue jumped 67% in the quarter to $2.73 billion from $1.64 billion a year ago. The company said growth in AI infrastructure is ‚Äúcreating an outsized opportunity for our Energy storage products to stabilize the grid, shift energy when it is needed most and provide additional power capacity.‚Äù

Tesla uses foreign suppliers for its energy business. The company said ‚Äúincreasing tariffs may cause market volatility and near-term impacts to supply and demand.‚Äù

popular,I‚Äôm a nurse and I 100 percent judge people based on their veins,"Okay, so I know this might sound weird, but I have to confess something. I am a nurse, and I definitely judge patients based on their veins.

If you have big, straight, beautiful veins, I instantly love you. You are the MVP. I could get blood or start an IV with my eyes closed. But if your veins are tiny, hard to find, or moving around like they are trying to escape, I am already mentally preparing for a struggle.

I always stay calm and professional on the outside, but inside, I am either celebrating or quietly panicking.

So yes, if you have ever wondered whether your nurse is silently evaluating your veins, the answer is absolutely yes.",2123,813,2025-04-23 05:23:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1k5pge9/im_a_nurse_and_i_100_percent_judge_people_based/,2025-04-23 12:56:52.751422

trendingreddits,How to Prepare Americans for Upcoming Job Loss Due to AI,"As artificial intelligence (AI) continues to evolve, it‚Äôs becoming increasingly clear that its impact on the workforce will be profound. While AI promises greater efficiency, lower costs, and new industries, it also poses a significant threat to many traditional jobs‚Äîespecially those involving repetitive, rule-based tasks. For Americans, the challenge ahead isn‚Äôt just technological‚Äîit‚Äôs personal, economic, and cultural.


What Jobs Are Most at Risk?
Let‚Äôs be honest ‚Äî it‚Äôs the working class that‚Äôs getting hit first.
Not all jobs are equally vulnerable to AI automation. Roles that involve routine, repetitive tasks are the most at risk. So how can workers prepare for the AI-driven transformation of the labor market? Here‚Äôs a look at what‚Äôs coming, and what can be done about it. These include:

Administrative support (data entry, payroll, scheduling)

Transportation (drivers, delivery)

Retail and customer service

Basic manufacturing and warehouse jobs

Even white-collar jobs in finance, legal services, and journalism are starting to see AI encroach on tasks like report writing, contract analysis, and data interpretation.
