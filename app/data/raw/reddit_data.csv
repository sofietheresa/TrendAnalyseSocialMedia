all,AITAH for telling my best friend her marriage is doomed at her bachelorette party and accidentally getting the wedding canceled,"This weekend was a disaster...

I 27F have been best friends with Amy 28F for years. She has been with this guy Jake for about three years, and honestly, he is a walking red flag. He is super controlling, jealous, and always checking her location. Once, he called her nine times while we were just shopping at Target. Amy keeps defending him, saying he is just protective because he cares so much. Whatever 
At her bachelorette party, it was supposed to be a fun girls night, but Jake kept blowing up her phone. Texts, FaceTimes, asking where she was, accusing her of acting single. She kept leaving to call him back, crying and apologizing, while the rest of us sat there awkwardly. After about the fourth time she left the table, I just lost it. When she came back, I said loud enough for the whole table to hear
You are not marrying a husband, you are signing up for a lifetime of being babysat by a jealous manchild. Amy started crying and ran out of the bar, half the girls followed her
Later that night, her mom called me, drunk, thanking me, because apparently they have all been worried about Jake but did not know how to stop the wedding. Her mom told Amy if she goes through with the wedding, they will not pay for it. Now Amy has blocked Jake, moved out of their apartment, and moved back into her parents house. But she also blocked me for humiliating her
Half our friend group is saying I did the right thing. The other half is calling me jealous and toxic for blowing up her relationship right before the wedding.

So.. AITAH?",17380,1914,2025-05-07 02:03:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1kgjqgw/aitah_for_telling_my_best_friend_her_marriage_is/,2025-05-07 11:03:58.051533

popular,AITA for refusing to let my daughter’s fiancé stay in our guest room because I use it for my hobby?,"So I (M49) might be in the wrong here, but I honestly don’t think I am, and would love to hear outside perspectives.

My daughter (23F) got engaged recently and came to visit us with her fiancé (24M). We live a few states away, so I get that traveling is tiring, but we were happy to host, for the weekend.

Now, I’ve had my guest room set up for my miniature wargaming for the past few years. It’s my space, where I go to decompress after work, and it's honestly the only spot in the house that's fully mine. My wife has the sunroom, and the rest of the house is kind of communal. I’ve got thousands of dollars of models in there, custom terrain, a 3D printer setup, etc. It’s not just a hobby, it’s an investment, and frankly, a form of art.

Anyway, when they arrived, I had the office couch made up for them, pull-out, memory foam, decent blanket, very clean. My daughter seemed fine with it, but her fiancé kind of made a face and later asked why they couldn’t just sleep in the guest room. I told him plainly it wasn’t available because it’s not a guest room anymore. It’s my studio.

Later that night, my daughter confronted me privately and said I was being selfish and ridiculous and that it’s just for two nights. She said they felt unwelcome and like I was prioritizing plastic figurines over family. I told her that’s not fair, they have a place to sleep. It’s not like I made them sleep on the floor.

Now my wife is giving me the cold shoulder and said I could have just packed it up for a weekend, but again, it’s not like these are toys you throw in a box. Some of them are fragile. Some are half-painted. I don’t want to spend days reorganizing and then undoing all that work just because they didn’t like the setup.

They left a day early, and now I’m getting texts from my daughter about how I chose my hobby over her happiness, which just seems dramatic to me.

I might be the asshole because maybe I could’ve moved some stuff around for a few nights, but I really don’t think it’s fair to expect me to dismantle my entire setup just because someone didn’t want to sleep on a perfectly good pull-out. I have a right to my space too, right?",8064,4265,2025-05-06 18:29:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1kg8vng/aita_for_refusing_to_let_my_daughters_fiancé_stay/,2025-05-07 11:03:58.051533
popular,GTA VI | Trailer 2 + New Information Megathread,"Since we've been flooded with thousands of posts and articles of the trailer, some of them with there links broken, some with abominable titles and others with the youtube link scuffed, this thread can be used for a comprehensive detail of everything Rockstar has released today.

This thread will keep updating with all the information, refresh every once in a while.

**Trailer** **2** \- [https://youtu.be/VQRLujxTm3c?si=I2L6zrTSZSt9W1SX](https://youtu.be/VQRLujxTm3c?si=I2L6zrTSZSt9W1SX)

**Official Plot:** “Set in Vice City, Jason & Lucia have always known the deck is stacked against them. But when an easy score goes wrong, they find themselves on the darkest side of the sunniest place in America, in the middle of a conspiracy stretching across the state of Leonida — forced to rely on each other more than ever if they want to make it out alive”

Rockstar has also released new info on their website: [https://www.rockstargames.com/VI](https://www.rockstargames.com/VI)

A detail of some of the characters below, starting out with the two main protagonists **Jason and Lucia**:

# Jason Duval

Jason wants an easy life, but things just keep getting harder.

Jason grew up around grifters and crooks. After a stint in the Army trying to shake off his troubled teens, he found himself in the Keys doing what he knows best, working for local drug runners. It might be time to try something new.

Meeting Lucia could be the best or worst thing to ever happen to him. Jason knows how he'd like it to turn out but right now, it's hard to tell.

# Lucia Caminos

Lucia’s father taught her to fight as soon as she could walk.

Life has been coming at her swinging ever since. Fighting for her family landed her in the Leonida Penitentiary. Sheer luck got her out. Lucia’s learned her lesson — only smart moves from here.

More than anything, Lucia wants the good life her mom has dreamed of since their days in Liberty City — but instead of half-baked fantasies, Lucia is prepared to take matters into her own hands.

# Cal Hampton

What if everything on the internet was true?

Jason’s friend and a fellow associate of Brian’s, Cal feels safest hanging at home, snooping on Coast Guard comms with a few beers and some private browser tabs open. Cal Hampton

""The psychopaths are in charge. Get used to it.""

Cal is at the low tide of America and happy there. Casual paranoia loves company, but his friend Jason has bigger plans.

# Boobie Ike

It's all about heart — the Jack of Hearts.

Boobie is a local Vice City legend — and acts like it. One of the few to transform his time in the streets into a legitimate empire spanning real estate, a strip club, and a recording studio — Boobie's all smiles until it's time to talk business.

""The club money pay for the studio, and the drug money pay for it all.""

Top quality cuts.

Boobie might seem like he's just out for himself, but it's his partnership with the young aspiring music mogul Dre'Quan for Only Raw Records that he's most invested in — now they just need a hit.

https://preview.redd.it/30utmhzd56ze1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=de6bb7fe87b225670b697ba9265d536a719db3fb

# Dre'Quan Priest

Only Raw... Records

Dre'Quan was always more of a hustler than a gangster. Even when he was dealing on the streets to make ends meet, breaking into music was the goal.

""Dancers are like my A&Rs. If the record's a hit, DJs gonna be spinnin' it.""

You're with the label now.

Now that he's signed the Real Dimez, Dre'Quan's days of booking acts into Boobie's strip club might be numbered as he sets his sights on the Vice City scene.

https://preview.redd.it/h87j44mq66ze1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6e93c4bf0b033fd1cdbd87112562295596e267e0

# Real Dimez

Viral videos. Viral hooks.

Bae-Luxe and Roxy aka Real Dimez have been friends since high school — girls with the savvy to turn their time shaking down local dealers into cold, hard cash via spicy rap tracks and a relentless social media presence.

""All my dimes in this club. Meet my twin, make it a dub.""

One hit away from fame.

An early hit single with local rapper DWNPLY took Real Dimez to new heights. Now, after five years and a whole lot of trouble, they’re signed to Only Raw Records, hoping lightning can strike twice.

https://preview.redd.it/8he2i8lz66ze1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=545da6c0b0fc19db99f97ec8de70d814b9d42ae0

# Raul Bautista

Experience counts.

Confidence, charm, and cunning — Raul’s a seasoned bank robber always on the hunt for talent ready to take the risks that bring the biggest rewards.

""Life is full of surprises, my friend. I think we'd all be wise to remember that.""

A professional adapts.

Raul's recklessness raises the stakes with every score. Sooner or later, his crew will have to double down or pull their chips from the table.

https://preview.redd.it/m4xuz76b76ze1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e712cc119a56d4db653fc505b75fda83027a74ea

# Brian Heder

Nothing better than a Mudslide at sunset.

Brian's a classic drug runner from the golden age of smuggling in the Keys. Still moving product through his boat yard with his third wife, Lori, Brian's been around long enough to let others do his dirty work.

""I hauled so much grass in that plane, I could make the state of Leonida levitate.""

Looks like a Leonida beach bum — moves like a great white shark.

Brian’s letting Jason live rent-free at one of his properties — so long as he helps with local shakedowns, and stops by for Lori’s sangria once in a while.

Now info on some of the locations:

# VICE CITY

Everything in Excess

We're a long way from the '80s, but Vice City is still the sun and fun capital of America.

The glamour, hustle, and greed of America captured in a single city. Each neighborhood has something to offer, from the pastel art deco hotels and bright white sands of Ocean Beach, to the bustling panaderías of Little Cuba and the bootleg brands of the Tisha-Wocka flea market, out to the VC Port, the cruise ship capital of the world.

# GRASSRIVERS

Welcome to the Wetlands

The untamable jewel of Leonida’s crown.

You never know what lies beneath the surface of this primordial expanse. The gators may be the most famous attraction, but there are far deadlier predators and weirder discoveries among the mangroves.

# PORT GELLHORN

  
Live Hard

This is Leonida’s forgotten coast.

Cheap motels, shut-down attractions, and empty strip malls won’t bring the tourists back, but there’s a new economy in this once-popular vacation spot. It’s fueled by malt liquor, painkillers, and truck stop energy drinks. Jump on a dirt bike and hold onto your wallet.

AMBROSIA

Keeping Leonida Sweet

The battle for the health and wealth of Leonida begins here.

In the heart of Leonida, American industry and old school values still reign supreme — whatever the cost. The Allied Crystal sugar refinery provides the jobs, while the local biker gang provides almost everything else.

# MOUNT KALAGA NATIONAL PARK

  
Wild, Wild Country

Room to breathe on the state's northern fringes.

A national landmark up against the state’s northern border, Mount Kalaga offers prime hunting, fishing, and off-road trails. In the lush surrounding backwoods, hillbilly mystics and paranoid radicals live far from the prying eyes of the government.

popular,I did it. I got a dumpster. My kids are NOT dealing with what I just did.,"Both of my parents are gone. My father passed in February. Emptying the house was a nightmare. There were a lot of great mementos, but where do you draw the line? 

We found so many things that are really cool but they were hidden away. They basically just took up space. So! Much! Stuff! I was torn between keeping things for nostalgia or being realistic. Then I realized that keeping things for the sake of nostalgia was what caused all this chaos. 
We kept some precious momentos and donated a lot of things. But it's May now and just finished the job. We ended up throwing out a lot of stuff. I'm willing to bet my parents put them away and never looked at them again.

I get it, I want to keep everything with a memory attached. But this opened my eyes. What stuff do I have saved just to save it? Stuff I never look at? 

So I did it. I got a dumpster and yesterday I went through everything and just got rid of it. I told my kids to get what they want because I'm getting rid of everything else. I kept a few things for myself. 

I don't want my kids to spend months going through my things and figuring out what to throw away, what to keep, and what to donate. 

It was freeing. I understand why they kept the stuff, I feel the same way about my things. But it reaches a point where it's almost ridiculous. I'm glad I did it. Today I'm doing a really deep cleaning of my home. It'll be wonderful when I'm done, almost like a new start.

Happy Tuesday! 🙂

popular,"Now that the Switch 1 generation is winding down, what were your most DISAPPOINTING purchases on this console?","Every game console, no matter how well or poorly it sold, is gonna have some disappointments thrown in there. Especially if said disappointments came from 1st party developers. I have 3 big candidates based on my own purchases, starting with my biggest letdown:

**1) Mario Strikers Battle League:** After frantically buying this game to play some multiplayer matches with friends, I realized what a terrible mistake I made after chewing through all the single player content in a matter of days. There is *nothing* to do in this game besides regular soccer matches, the online is abysmal, and the amount of content available at launch and even now is just laughable for a sequel. I thought my perception of Mario Strikers as a whole would be ruined forever, so I went ahead and booted up Strikers Charged on Wii and nope, that game holds up incredibly well! This was just a bad sequel all around.

**2) Mario Golf Super Rush:** Speaking of bad sequels, Super Rush decided to simplify the golfing mechanics to a point where it just isn’t fun to play for me. As someone who adored the 3DS game Mario Golf World Tour, which was packed with content, modes, and unlockables and had worthwhile paid DLC on top of that, Super Rush felt like it was playing catch up with all its free updates. Was this how Animal Crossing fans felt when New Horizons was first released, having to wait months for features that were already available in the 3DS predecessor? Yikes.

**3) Splatoon 3:** This is more of a personal pick than a general consensus. I really got into Splatoon 1 and 2, but I was just Splatoon’d out by the time the third game came around. No new modes, online that had more disconnects than either of the first two games in my experience, and a longer grind for unlockables that could rival a modern day hero shooter. Call me old but I missed the more “pick up and play” nature of Splatoon 1, and I just don’t get that with Splatoon 3. Also the fact that they sold the first game’s hubworld back as paid DLC is utter nonsense to me.",1961,2301,2025-05-06 23:33:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1kggeu8/now_that_the_switch_1_generation_is_winding_down/,2025-05-07 11:03:58.051533
popular,AITAH for telling my best friend her marriage is doomed at her bachelorette party and accidentally getting the wedding canceled,"This weekend was a disaster...

I 27F have been best friends with Amy 28F for years. She has been with this guy Jake for about three years, and honestly, he is a walking red flag. He is super controlling, jealous, and always checking her location. Once, he called her nine times while we were just shopping at Target. Amy keeps defending him, saying he is just protective because he cares so much. Whatever 
At her bachelorette party, it was supposed to be a fun girls night, but Jake kept blowing up her phone. Texts, FaceTimes, asking where she was, accusing her of acting single. She kept leaving to call him back, crying and apologizing, while the rest of us sat there awkwardly. After about the fourth time she left the table, I just lost it. When she came back, I said loud enough for the whole table to hear
You are not marrying a husband, you are signing up for a lifetime of being babysat by a jealous manchild. Amy started crying and ran out of the bar, half the girls followed her
Later that night, her mom called me, drunk, thanking me, because apparently they have all been worried about Jake but did not know how to stop the wedding. Her mom told Amy if she goes through with the wedding, they will not pay for it. Now Amy has blocked Jake, moved out of their apartment, and moved back into her parents house. But she also blocked me for humiliating her
Half our friend group is saying I did the right thing. The other half is calling me jealous and toxic for blowing up her relationship right before the wedding.

trendingreddits,The Shiloh Hendrix situation?!?!,"This is INSANITY! I genuinely want to know why anyone would donate to her?! I understand she might have been frustrated with the kid… but calling him the N word and never apologizing, yet making over half a million dollars from it is INSANE! She just keeps saying “I called him for what he was.” She obviously is racist. If she would have apologized for calling him that slur, things would be a little better. 

I have lost hope for our world.

For those of you that don’t know.. allegedly, a little boy took something from Shiloh’s son’s diaper bag (some people are saying he was five years old, some are saying he’s older, many are also saying he’s autistic), so she called him the N word and got caught. A man took a video of her admitting it and she shows no sympathy… now she’s out there making lots of money out of it.

trendingreddits,How To Guide | The Smart Blogger’s Path to a Steady Online Income,"Blogging isn’t dead—it’s evolved. What once began as an online journal has grown into a powerful tool for building authority, growing an audience, and generating sustainable income. Whether you’re a solopreneur, side hustler, or small business owner, blogging is still one of the smartest ways to earn online. But success doesn’t come overnight—it takes strategy, consistency, and knowing what works today.

In this guide, we’ll break down the path smart bloggers take to turn their writing into a steady source of income—and how you can do the same.

Why Blogging Still Works in 2025
Despite the explosion of video content and social media, blogging continues to thrive. Why? Because search engines still prioritize quality written content. People turn to Google every day with questions, and blogs that offer valuable answers continue to rise to the top.

According to a HubSpot study, businesses that blog get 55% more website visitors than those that don’t. This is especially important for American entrepreneurs looking to build authority in competitive niches.

Real-World Example: NerdWallet
NerdWallet, a personal finance company, built its multi-million-dollar brand primarily through blogging. By publishing SEO-optimized content that answered common money questions, it attracted millions of readers—and converted them into users of its affiliate partners and services.

Now we have many ways for you to find the spaces you love - including a leader board, personalized recommendations, improved onboarding for new users and others on the way. 

With all of that, and with the site continuing to grow, we’ve decided it’s now time to retire this community and the daily parade of trending communities. For the next week, ending on Sunday June 13, we’ll be hand selecting communities to feature based mainly on our whims in part to celebrate this little community and all the other communities it helped put on your radar.

Thanks to all of _you,_ users and mods, for making this and reddit a very special place.

By December 1993, Wilson desired to work in a band environment, and so brought on frequent collaborators. The band has been on hiatus since 2010.

Welcome to the subreddit of the poet laureate of rock 'n' roll.

The voice of the promise of the '60s counter-culture. The guy who forced folk into bed with rock. Who donned make-up in the '70s and disappeared into a haze of substance abuse. Who emerged to find Jesus. Who was written off as a has-been by the end of the '80s and who suddenly shifted gears, releasing some of the strongest music of his career beginning in the late '90s.

Ladies and gentlemen — Columbia recording artist Bob Dylan!
